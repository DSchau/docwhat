Alrighty! I have me a new look and it is FRESH. ;-)

I got sick of working around some of the problems in
<a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">sandbox</a>. I don't want to
maintain an offshoot of an existing theme (or worse, code my own); I've done
that before it I don't like it.

So using some simple patches to add some extra
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic markup</a> to the
default wordpress theme, I created this page.

Notice how it has a nice
<a title="A List Apart article about Fluid Grids" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fluidgrids">fluid
grid</a> and how it handles resizing very well.  The CSS is actually kind of
straight-forward too.  Though it could be minimized more, which I'll do
eventually.

I also downloaded WPTouch and will be playing with that shortly.

w00t!

PS: I'm not trying to bad-mouth sandbox. It's a great theme.  It's just that it
hasn't been maintained or improved for a while. Wordpress 2.7 has lots of spiffy
new features and sandbox doesn't make use of them.  Worse, some of the features
are similar, but not quite the same; plugins break on sandbox because of that.
 And of course, the developer is trying to
<a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/2009/01/looking-for-a-wordpress-brand/">sell it
off</a>. :-/

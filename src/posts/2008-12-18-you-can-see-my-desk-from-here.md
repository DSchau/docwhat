Pop City did an article about my workplace and
[you can see my desk](http://www.popcitymedia.com/timnews/vivisimo1217.aspx)
in the photo.

BTW: This blog is unrelated to my workplace; none of my comments here should
be construed to reflect opinion of my past, present or future employers.
Though it is a cool place to work with [many](http://peterpawlowski.com/)

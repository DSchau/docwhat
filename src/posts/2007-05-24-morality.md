title: Morality
---

I ran across an interesting forum post on the
[Richard Dawkins](http://www.richarddawkins.net/) website. It points to a
morality quiz and a video of Jonathan Haidt talking about a way of thinking
about morality that he has developed that helps him understand how different
people (specifically conservatives) think about morality and why someone who
is liberal has a hard time understanding where they come from.

Before I tell you where the video and the forum thread is at, let me ask you
to take the morality quiz at [yourmorals.org](http://www.yourmorals.org/). The
quiz will probably be more accurate before you see the video and start
thinking about it too much. Go ahead, take it. I'll wait.

Okay, welcome back.

Now you can watch the
[video](http://www.newyorker.com/online/video/conference/2007/haidt), which is
part of the New Yorker magazine's 2012: Stories of the Near Future conference.
The video is about 24 minutes long, if I remember correctly.

The
[forum post](http://www.richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15021&sid=6e15f2a4f958fa71f374b8e13a2200a7)
itself is interesting as well.

Finally, my scores for the Moral Foundations Questionnaire:

    Harm:      2.7
    Fairness:  2.3
    Loyalty:   1.5
    Authority: 1.0
    Purity:    0.7

What did you get?

Ciao!

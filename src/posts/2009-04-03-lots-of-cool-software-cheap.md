If you haven't heard of
<a href="http://www.macheist.com/bundle/u/314119/">MacHeist</a>, then you should
go check it out right now.  It's only good for four more days. What they do is
sell a bundle for $39 that includes lots of different mac software from
different vendors.

They exact amount of software you'll get depends on how many people sign up.  As
each milestone is met, another package is unlocked. 25% of the $39 goes to one
of their 10 charities (or split between all 10), your choice.

They also have other little "missions" and side things to get more software.
Right now, for example, they have a
<a href="http://www.macheist.com/tweetblast">tweetblast</a> that'll get you
<a href="http://delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library 2</a> and really fun
game, <a href="http://www.introversion.co.uk/multiwinia/">Multiwinia</a>.

So <a href="http://www.macheist.com/bundle/u/314119/">go</a> and donate to
charity and have a blast playing with all the software. ;-)

Ciao!

If someone hears voices that tell them to do something, we call them crazy.

If someone reads a book of fiction and tries to act as if it is talking to them
and telling them what to do, we call that crazy.

How is [this](http://richarddawkins.net/article,2560,n,n) not insanity? Â How is
this called anything but completely fucking bug-nuts?

Update 2008-06-02: And of course you knew that these ass-hole idiots wouldn't
rest till
[they finished off the mother](http://www.unscrewingtheinscrutable.com/node/1914 'Death of a woman.').

As I
<a href="http://docwhat.org/2009/03/how-to-make-a-customer-want-to-leave/">mentioned
before</a>, I have been having trouble with Speakeasy.  I had already researched
other competitors and was contemplating changing to someone else.  I would have
missed the technical competency of Speakeasy support but I could live with the
people who follow scripts.

Fortunately, I was called by Prince (name changed to protect the innocent); a
manager for Speakeasy.  He fixed everything; he waived all costs (about $300)
which includes the modem.  He agreed that paying for sub-par service wasn't
reasonable. After all, I could have stayed with
<a href="http://docwhat.org/2008/02/verizon-sucks/">Verizon</a> for that
(zing!).

He said that SpaceGhost never contacted him or filed a ticket for the manager to
talk to me.  Apparently something in the ticket alerted him. I suspect it was
that the ticket was open for 2 weeks.

So I am a happy person.

I have abandoned my
<a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/complaint-letters/how-to-launch-an-executive-email-carpet-bomb-259713.php">EECB</a> planning
and have returned to DEFCON 5. It would have been a real pain if I had to switch
vendors.

Ciao!

I was walking through Squirrel Hill today with Robin and my Dad.  There was a house with some junk on their porch and a sign saying, "For sale. $1 each."  I looked through the stuff and found an <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/hx-20.html" rel="tag">Epson HX-20</a>!

<em>Oh. My. Gawd!</em>

When I was in High School a guy named Randy had a <a href="http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/trs80-model100/" rel="tag">TRS80 Model 100</a> portable computer (made in 1983).  It was the coolest thing.  I got him to loan it to me so I could write a small text adventure (only like 6 rooms, but a huge deal at the time).

<!--more-->Anyway, back to the present.

I paid the lady her $1 and took it with me.  I thought at worst, it wouldn't work or would be stupid or something.  It'd be a buck wasted and I'd give it to <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.vonhagen.org/" rel="friend met co-worker" title="Ex-Punk rocker, book author, and computer-phile.">Bill von Hagen</a> who'd add it to his collection, even if it's not working.

<div class="pqr" style="font-size: 0.8em">I just discovered that the wall-wart that came with it was a <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~fjkraan/comp/hx20/adapter.html">6v @ 600mA wall-wart</a> not 6v 300ma I got.  Since it charges the NiCd batteries directly (don't try to run it plugged in!) I don think it matters much.  Except it'll charge slower.</div>The computer had no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply" rel="tag">wall-wart</a> or it's carrying case (I didn't know when I bought it for $1 that it even had a carrying case). But I took one of the other wall-warts the lady was selling that matched the specs and charged it at home. 

<strong>It works!</strong>

I even found the old <a href="http://support.epson.com/hardware/computer/portable/hx20__/index.html">manuals</a> on-line and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/abcmcfarren/hx20/hx20.htm">software</a>.

Wow.  This is cool.

It has two Hitachi 6301 cpus and even a built in  printer, for goodness sake.  How cool is that.  I figure at worst, I can open it up and replace the batteries with regular batteries or something.  It uses NiCd batteries, I have no clue how old they are.

Ciao!

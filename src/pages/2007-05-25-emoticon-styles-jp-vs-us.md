I found this interesting article about <a href="http://www.livescience.com/health/070510_facial_culture.html">Americans and Japanese read faces differently</a>.  To cut the article short, they explain that Japanese culture seems to read the eyes for emotional cues while American culture seems to read the mouth.

Quick comparison of <a rel="tag" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons">emoticons</a>:
<pre> US      JP

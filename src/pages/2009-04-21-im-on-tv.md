I'm on TV at KDKA; They did a <a href="http://kdka.com/kdkainvestigators/Pittsburgh.immigration.future.2.989907.html">report on immigration in Pittsburgh</a> and I was one of the backdrops used for the voice over.  You can see my desk as the reporter talks to <a href="http://searchdoneright.com/author/valdes/">Raul</a> and he walks past the stairs at about 2:47.  And again you can see me up close and scary at 2:55.

It's really my fault since I asked the cameraman about his camera.  I thought that with all the cool new technology out that the camera would be smaller than it was. It looked just like the ones I saw 10-20 years ago.  He said that there was an advantage to it being large: longer battery life and more stability.

The footage was taken about 4 weeks ago, if I remember correctly.

Ciao!

Who knows what happened; a slip of the finger, an out-of-date web browser, or
maybe one of your bytes is wandering lost around the internet.

Things you could do to try to salvage the day:

* You can try the [home page](/) where you can browse around till you lose the
  uneasy feeling that the internet is out to get you.
* You can search for what you are looking for using the handy search box
  below.
* You can go back to bed and pull the covers over your head.

I suggest hiding in bed; It seems the safest.

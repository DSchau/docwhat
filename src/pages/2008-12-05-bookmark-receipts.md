This is something that's been floating around in my head since I saw the tiny little printer at the public library that they use to print out your receipt.

The idea is simple: Print out your receipt (at libraries, bookstores, etc.) on card-stock in the shape of a bookmark.

This allows for a lot of room for customization; you can put logos on the back and corners, etc.

I just got <a name="evtst|a|1401203078" href="http://www.amazon.com/League-Extraordinary-Gentlemen-Black-Dossier/dp/1401203078%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1401203078">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Black Dossier</a> via Amazon and immediately folded up the receipt to use as a bookmark.  This made me think of my idea again.

They could break the receipt up into two parts; the mailing label and non-book items on a piece of paper while the books would be listed on a bookmark.

I dunno. Maybe it doesn't work that well for Amazon. They'd probably find it easier to just print up a million bookmarks and chuck them in the box.

But it'd be really nice at a local bookstore.  It'd be an extra bit of niceness that would encourage people to come back.

Ciao!

There is a nifty new project for the Android phone: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">Android Scripting Environment</a>.

This lets you use <a href="http://lua.org">Lua</a> and <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> to write scripts on Android.Â  Not quite the same as writing a whole application in those languages, but a great start!

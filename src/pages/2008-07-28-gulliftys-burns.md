Aaah!  There was a <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=SLr&amp;resnum=0&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ncl=1230793040">fire at Gullifty's</a> early Sunday morning!  I saw the borded up front door on the way into work this morning.

Gullifty's is known for it's desserts and Jazz, but I have used it most for good Bloody Marys and for being open late.

ADDED (2008/08/11): A sign says that it'll reopen Wednesday, August 13th, 2008. Yay!

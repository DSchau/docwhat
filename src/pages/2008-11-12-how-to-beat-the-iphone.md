For all those cell phone companies trying to figure out how to beat AT&amp;T's stranglehold on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">iPhone</a>; here's a strategy that will let you go past it.

Create a new phone.  It should be simple.  It should include only a contact list, SMS, and voice mail.  It should not include calendars, mp3 players, or anything else.  It should be sleek, simple and stylish.

It should have one other feature: it should be able to act as a very short range WAP using wifi, bluetooth, or usb.

Why?

Because then a person can buy an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_touch">iPod Touch</a> or any other wifi, bluetooth, or usb networkable device and use <em>your service</em>.  Notice that the same phone can be used to connect a laptop, a netbook, a PDA, or anything else.

Ciao!

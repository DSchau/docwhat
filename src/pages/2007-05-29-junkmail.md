My [mother](http://dianewillis.com/), who has a lot of friends that send
her hoaxes, email chain letters and other forms of internet tomfoolery
on a regular basis, got an email from [41 Pounds](http://41pounds.org/).
41 Pounds claims that they will stop your US Postal junk mail if you
give them money.

I took a quick look around and found similar services at
[StopTheJunkMail](http://stopthejunkmail.com) and
[Greendimes](http://greendimes.com/).

I cannot tell if these are legit or not; Doing searches on the internet
are largely self referential. The problem with this kind of service is
that they could, in theory, sign you up for the [Direct Marketing
Association](http://the-dma.org/)'s [do-not-mail
list](https://www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offmailing) and stop there. You
would notice a decrease in mail and everything else they could say,
"Well, we stopped a whole lot. We can't be perfect." How could you tell?

The best way to ensure that you don't get any more junk mail is to [do
it your self](http://www.obviously.com/junkmail/). You'll know what
happened, how to do it again, and if you want to give money to charities
you can do that directly.

Ciao!

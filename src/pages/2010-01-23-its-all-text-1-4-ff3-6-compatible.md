I have just finished Firefox 3.6 after working like crazy since FF 3.6 came out.

It only works in FF3.6, but the statistics show that the users of It's All Text! upgrade their browser almost immediately after a new version comes out, so I'm not worried.

It's approved and available via the [normal spot](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125).

I apologize for not getting this done before FF 3.6. I don't have a real excuse except being lazy and busy with other things. But I have to say the amount of emails I got asking for a FF 3.6 version definitely got me off my butt. ;-)

Ciao!

Wow!  I found a blog post talking about <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/4125">It's All Text!</a> on a blog called <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nyama/">Another 朝顔日記</a> written in <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/japanese" rel="tag">japanese</a>!

According to <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" rel="tag">babelfish</a>, the author <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nyama/20070309/1173408162">found a silly bug</a> [<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr?trurl=http%3A%2F%2Fd.hatena.ne.jp%2Fnyama%2F20070309%2F1173408162&lp=ja_en&btnTrUrl=Translate">english</a>] in It's All Text! (I left out a <code>var</code> declaration) and is explaining the way to fix this.  Neat!

I have fixed it, of course.  But I can't help thinking how useful this would have been back when I worked at <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/turbolinux" rel="tag">TurboLinux</a>.

I actually wrote some palm software way back, and I got calls from Japanese magazines that wanted to put my software on a CD in their magazine.  My software was <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gpl" rel="tag">GPL</a>'ed, so they didn't really have at ask.  I requested that they send a copy of the magazines to me.  Many months later, I was pleased to receive two of them.

I really want to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara" rel="tag">Akihabara</a> some day.  It sounds like geek paradise. :-)

Ciao!</narf>

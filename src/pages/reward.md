Some people have asked for a way to reward me or to encourage me to work on my
code. And so I have obliged.

These links all open in new windows, so that you can look at them and decide
which you would prefer to use.

* [Email me](/email) A hearty "Thank You!" Tell me what I've done to improve
  your life!
* [Think Geek Wishlist](http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/gimme.cgi?wid=81e27ae08)
* [Paypal Me!](http://paypal.me/holtje/5.99)
* Post me a letter, postcard, stickers, or items unique to your homeland! I'll
  blog about anything I get. :-)

Personally, I prefer to get something unexpected and fun!

Ciao!

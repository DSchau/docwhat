title: Interview with Alison Bechdel
---

If you aren't into comic art, skip this...

I found a video of an interview with [Alison
Bechdel](http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/alison-bechdel) a really good
comic artist. I loved her autobiographical book [*Fun
Home*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618871713/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedocwha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0618871713).
The story was engaging and the art was so enjoyable to look at.

In the video she is working on her next book, [*Are You My
Mother?*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618982507/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedocwha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0618982507)
a follow up to to *Fun Home*. She is being interviewed by an English
professor, Hillary Chute, from the University of Chicago (Yay! Hyde
Park!).

*Fun Home* was about her father and how she discovered she was gay
while living in rural Pennsylvania. I definitely wanted to read
more, so I'm excited she's working on another book about her life.

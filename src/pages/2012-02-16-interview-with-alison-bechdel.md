<p>If you aren't into comic art, skip this...</p>

<p>I found the a video of an interview with <a href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/alison-bechdel">Alison Bechdel</a> a really good comic artist.  I loved her autobiographical book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618871713/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedocwha-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0618871713"><em>Fun Home</em></a>. The story was engaging and the art was so enjoyable to look at.</p>

<p>In the video she is working on her next book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618982507/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedocwha-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0618982507"><em>Are You My Mother?</em></a> a follow up to to <em>Fun Home</em>. She is being interviewed by an English professor, Hillary Chute, from the University of Chicago (yay! Hyde Park!).</p>

<p><em>Fun Home</em> was about her father and how she discovered she was gay while living in rural Pennsylvania.  I definitely wanted to read more, so I'm excited she's working on another book about her life.</p>

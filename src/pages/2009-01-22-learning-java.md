Since I have an <a title="Wikipedia article on Google Android" rel="tag" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Android">Android</a> phone I have to write software for it.  To write software for the phone, I have to use <a title="Wikipedia article for Java" rel="tag" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>.

I've been looking around for something like <a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Dive Into Python</a> but for Java.  So far, no luck.

Any recommendations would be very welcome.

A friend who does work on an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> plugin/extension recommended the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">Sun Java tutorials</a> but says:
<blockquote>I never really used it as a "course".  I.e. I didn't start from the beginning and go chapter by chapter. I think I like it because it is organized by subject, so you can just jump down to whatever you are interested in.  I never really found an actual physical book that I liked.</blockquote>
Another friend has loaned me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Java-3rd-Patrick-Niemeyer/dp/1600330010%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1600330010">Learning Java</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Nutshell-5th-David-Flanagan/dp/0596007736%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0596007736">Java In A Nutshell</a>.

I took the Sun web course on Java about 5 years ago, but I don't remember much about it.  The courses spent too much time on things found in all languages and not enough about what makes Java different than, say, Python or C++.

Ciao!

![Screenshot of Cosmic Wimpout](/files/2006/09/screenshot.gif) Way back when, I wrote a version of [Cosmic Wimpout](http://cosmicwimpout.com/) for the palm.

The page that had the links to the sources, the bug tracker, etc. have been slowly decaying. Since I have moved to a [new webpage](http://docwhat.gerf.org/2006/09/moving-to-a-blog/) I decided to move Cosmic Wimpout over to [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/).

Maybe someone will want to work on it. Or maybe I'll buy a new palm one of these days. I heard rumors that Palm runs linux or something like that.

Ciao!

**UPDATE 2011-03:** IÂ have moved it to github instead of hosting it locally. This project is really dead, but if it still works for you, great!

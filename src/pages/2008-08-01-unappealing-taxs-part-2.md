I just got the "Disposition of appeal from real estate assessment".  This is also known as the ruling.  In short, it says that the "evidence insufficient to change value"; no change.  Yay!

The only recourse the city has now is to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County within thirty days.  I hope they don't since I believe this is a civil court and that means that I would have to actually know what the heck I was doing. Or hire someone who does.

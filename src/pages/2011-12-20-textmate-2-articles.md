<p>Last week, TextMate 2.0 early-alpha <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/">was released</a>.  This release has been a long-time coming.  It includes lots of improvements that people have wanted for a long time.</p>

<p>I am currently a <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> user.  Mainly because I'm an OS X and do Ruby programing and TextMate has lots of things to make this easier.  I still love Emacs, though.  One of the things I've been waiting for has been mark-and-select (a.k.a. control-space in Emacs). I haven't seen it yet, but then again, I'm only starting to play with TM2.</p>

<p>This is just a post to place all the helpful links, posts, etc. into one place so I can stop leaving open tabs in my browser (and so you can see them too).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://erniemiller.org/2011/12/12/textmate-2-rmate-awesome/">rmate</a> is a way to open textmate from a remote system. Using it securely requires setting up SSH forwarding.</li>
<li>A new site: <a href="http://tm2tips.tumblr.com/">TextMate 2 tips</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/git-style-configuration/">.tm_properties</a> is the new way to configure projects.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://mads379.github.com/posts/whitespace-tmbundle">Whitespace Bundle</a> that shows invalid white space (think <code>git diff --check</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Ciao!</p>

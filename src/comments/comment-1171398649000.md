Alas, there isn't a waitpid or anything similar that I can find in Mozilla.  Very sad.  If there is one.  PLEASE tell me!  nsIProccess doesn't even have the exitValue and pid attributes working. *sigh*

It checks regularly, every few moments (modulo the browser being busy somewhere else, it's only single threaded).  You can control the refresh rate via the preferences.

The next version (0.4.x due out very soon) also refreshes when you mouse over the text area.  And it should update better, too.

Ciao!

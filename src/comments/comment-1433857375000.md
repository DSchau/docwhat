UPDATE:
I could fix the problem without ruby version ,it seems that my problem was that my vim-ruby plugin was trying to come with a list of instance_method for a variable that had a "vartype" of gets, like this:
some_var = gets.chomp
some_var.(and it'll crash)
But after following this steps, everything is working great now, sorry for incovenience!!

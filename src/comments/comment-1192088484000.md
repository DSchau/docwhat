There is a dropdown list where I can choose a filetype but the only entry there is "Application" which shows *.exe files and nothing else (for me). I'm no Windows expert, so I don't know if this is configurable somewhere or standard Windows behaviour - and as I'm @work I have no idea what extra configuring has been done for my machine.

The workaround is to enter the full filename or to enter "*" as the filename and hit the button "Open". Then Windows shows all the files in the directory - despite the file type still being shown as "Application" - that's Windows for you :)

I'd suggest to change filterApps to filterAll and rely on the user picking a file of the correct type. Imho, when the user is changing the editor in the preferences you should be able assume that he knows what he is doing.

Cheers,
Torsten

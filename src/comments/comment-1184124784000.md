I installed v0.7.3 of IAT to my Firefox, v2.0.0.4 for Windows.  It works mostly fine when I'm editing our internal wiki for editing (MediaWiki v1.7.1, PHP v5.1.2 (cgi-fcgi), MySQL v5.0.20a-nt).

That is, when I edit a single section of a wiki article, the page opens up normally, with the text displayed in the edit box.  The IAT "edit" gumdrop is in the right place, and everything works as it should.

However, when I press the "edit" button at the top of the article, to edit the whole article instead of a single section, what happens is this:  Firefox displays a pop-up dialog, called "Opening index.php", and saying: "You have chosen to open index.php, which is a: PHP file from [the URL]. What should Firefox do with this file?"  The given choices are "Open with [Browse button here", "FlashGot" (another extension I have, but deinstalled, still appearing as a grayed-out zombie, and "Save to Disc".  There is no way to get expected page to appear, that is, the normal wiki edit page with the editbox.

This behaviour only started after I installed IAT a short while ago today.

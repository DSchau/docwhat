Hi,

thanks for the great Add-on! I only discovered it recently, and am very excited.

I use Yahoo Mail. I know the text area for the message body is not really a text area, so I had no expectations here. But: the "To:", "Cc:" and "Bcc:" fields are text areas, so the plugin works here.

The downside is that the YMail autocomplete feature in these fields stops working with IAT enabled. Normally, I would start typing a name/email address, and get a list of suggestions, based on my Address Book. However, with IAT, this does not work. (For the record, I am using the new YMail, as opposed to YMail Classic.)

Is there anything that needs to be done here? I was thinking that perhaps the IAT Preferences would allow me to define a list of web addresses for which IAT would be disabled... Similar to the IE Tab add-on, which allows me to define a list of addresses for which to use the IE engine by default.

Feel free to contact me if I can provide more info on this.

Thanks again for the great add-on.

Sam

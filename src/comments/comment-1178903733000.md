I just noticed the preference to turn off the button - thanks. It did the trick for me. I use IAT so infrequently that it's totally OK that I right-click and select the edit option in the text field.

FYI, the problem webpage is www.furl.net, and it's the screen which comes up when you "Furl it!" from the bookmark bar.

Thank you for the feed back. :-D  I can't act on everything, in part because I've been busy.  I know that's frustrating if you like the extension and there is just *one* little thing that you want fixed... On the other hand, maybe it's the excuse you need to learn Javascript. :-D

re: flock - Yeah, that won't work because I hadn't heard of it before now.  I'll take a look.

re: JEdit - Since I don't allow setting arguments to the executable at the moment (because it is so hard to do cross-platform safely), you'll have to create a .cmd file to run those commands for you.

I'm planning on making the editor box editable again.  I have to verify that the file picker won't get interfere.

re: multiple instances of the same program. 

Is that a problem?  I only had TextEdit on my wifes Mac this morning and it works fine with multiple runnings.  I suspect that this is something beyond the scope of this extension. :-/

Thanks again for all your feedback. :-)

Ciao!

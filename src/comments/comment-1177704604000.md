Open is just a fancy way to open the file in whatever way the finder on OS X would normally do.  .app files are really directories which is what allows the mac to do drag and drop install instead of spewing files all over the place on windows.  Thus if you want to actually run the directory as an app rather than merely entering it you need to use open.  

Really this is more of a user knowledge issue than a problem with the way things work.  You can always enter inside the app and select the actual binary and run that (for instance that's what I do when I need to execute firefox --Profile-manager).  Anyway thanks for the extesion if it still has issues on the Mac maybe I will take a look at the code and see what I can do.

Following up; Seems to happen when a page in another tab loads or reloads.  Noticed when I posted my previous comment that the open edit box in the Firefox window next to this one jumped up to the home position.  It doesn't happen in a different browser instance where I don't have any extensions other than RSS Ticker and Noscript.

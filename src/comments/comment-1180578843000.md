Kendra & Margot:

I wanted to thank both you for responding.  I really appreciate your efforts.

:oops: I also wanted to apologize for breaking my comments box. I was upgrading the theme for my blog and I cut and paste something I shouldn't have.  I have marked it with a clear comment, so hopefully I won't make this mistake again.

Meanwhile, I see that StopTheJunkMail.com actually has a screen shot for their interface at: http://www.stopthejunkmail.com/junkmailoptoutlearnmore.cfm

Kendra said she has some images which I offered to put up for people to see, unless they decide to add them to their FAQ.

I do have a question though.  Why the donation to plant a tree, etc.?  Is there some reason to do that in addition to just stopping or slowing down junk mail?

Again, I'm sorry about messing up my comments.

Ciao!

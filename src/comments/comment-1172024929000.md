moinmoin and preview, redux

Docwhat, I don't think that the same filename gets generated when moinmoin generates a preview.

I'm going to see if there's a workflow I can glom onto, like forcing myself to use emacserver, that makes this easier, but for now I'd have to open a new emacs instance (and close the old one) every time I want to preview.

I'll think about this and see if there's any way to improve this.

Thanks,

-Peter

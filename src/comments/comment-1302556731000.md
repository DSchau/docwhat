You need to find out what codepages Win32pad uses. It depends on the program, which is why I don't provide a list.  That and the list is rather long... :-)

If Firefox doesn't understand the codepage, then it should return an error...but I haven't played with it much since UTF-8 is soooo much easier to use.

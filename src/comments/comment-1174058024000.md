Hugh: You're welcome! :-D  I'm happy people are using It's All Text!

Thanks for describing this strategy for MacOsX users.  It'll be helpful, I'm sure.

Regarding the button in the wrong place in gmail:  I'm still having troubling getting the button in the right place.  It's very irritating.  I had a strategy that worked some places, but not others.  I now have another strategy that works in other places, but not in some...  *sigh* I don't seem to be able to win.

Ciao!

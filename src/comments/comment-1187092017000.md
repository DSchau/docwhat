I really like the add-on, but I've found that it messes up some "special" characters (such as the em dash, â€” ). If I copy the text from the text editor and manually paste it into the web site, those characters copy in just fine. If I save the text-editor file and let your add-on do the text insertion on the page, those characters get replaced with a funky reverse-question-mark-set-in-a-diamond. Obviously, copying and pasting from the text editor is 2/3 of what this extension is supposed to avoid.

Otherwise, I'm happy with it. Keep up the good work, please.

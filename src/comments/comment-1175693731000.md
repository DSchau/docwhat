Bill von Hagen:

Thanks for checking out It's All Text!

Yup.  That'd be a bug.  I've been thinking how I'll have to fix that and the only thing I can think of at the moment is that I'll need to weed out any files that end with '~', '.bak', '.tmp' :-/

Seems hackish.  I guess I could make it an option.  But I can't think of the use case for the option so I guess I'll postpone adding it till someone can explain why.

Ciao!

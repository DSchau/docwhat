Hi Sue!

The dialog box sounds like a bug.  I think I might have solved in the
latest version, but I can't be sure since I don't have easy access to
Mac OS X.  I'll see if my wife will let me borrow her laptop to try
this out.  :-/

As I said, I don't have a Mac.  I'll spend a little time playing with
it this weekend, depending on how things go.

Ciao!

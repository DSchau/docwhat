Giuseppe:

I think what you say makes sense and matches much what I had originally.  I'm trying to remember why I changed it.  I think one of the reasons is that there are a lot of stat() calls happening because every textarea is monitored.  In the newer code there is also a problem with file extensions; the user can change the file extension at will.

I'll need to think about it some.

Maybe something like this:
<ol>
  <li>Load Page</li>
  <li>Walk through all files, looking for ones that match this base-name (host + hash), stripping off extension.
    <ul>
    <li>If none are found, continue.  Don't monitor for changes until edit button is pressed.</li>
    <li>If one is found, set the textarea to match that extension, delete the file and start monitoring for changes.</li>
    <li>If more than one is found, pick one and do the above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

One problem I do remember is that some editors, like gedit, will empty the buffer for a file that is deleted, which made the original behavior annoying.

Ciao!

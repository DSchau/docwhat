Am I just dim? I'm on a Mac, followed the instructions to create a shell script in my ~/ folder that runs fine.

When I put that into the Editor box in IAT (by hand, the browse option won't let me select it) all looks good.

First time I click edit my choice is removed and /usr/bin/open returns. What am I missing?

Yup. It's Firemacs on Windows, that interferes with It's All Text! v0.8.2 -- after disabling Firemacs, it works very nicely.  I suppose the solution, baring resolving hte conflict, is to use partial Emacs bindings only (since I will be using mostly Emacs 23 externally here), by employing the modification of toolkit.jar, specificially the pathHTMLsomething.xml file that contains keybindings.

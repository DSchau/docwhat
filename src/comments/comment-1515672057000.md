Margot - I am glad to hear confirmation of StoptheJunkMail as a legit service; I began to worry about this after signing up for the service and discovering that the site isn't secure - ?!?!?!?! That doesn't seem wise in this day and age. It's a real deal breaker - I'm hoping that you can get the site secured [now http &gt; secure https] ASAP so I don't have to cancel the service.

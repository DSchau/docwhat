As mentioned by PhiLho on the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125" rel="nofollow">plugin comments</a>, in the install.rdf file, you have set em:minVersion="3.6" instead of ="3.5". If this plugin does actually work with 3.5, please set the minVersion to 3.5.

I tried to file this as a bug report, but your Trac does not seem to support OpenID fully. I'm unable to log in using MyOpenID.com, and so I cannot file bug reports. You might want to check its configuration.

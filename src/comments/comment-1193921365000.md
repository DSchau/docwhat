<b>@fooman:</b>

Upgrade to 0.8.1 or newer.  That'll fix the win-key problem.  It was a stupidity on my part.

<b>@era:</b>

I think I know what you're talking about.  I'm working on another bug (involving some tabs never loading their content) and I suspect it'll fix this bug too.  I'm making changes to how IAT hooks into the page to load.

Before it was hooking into the entire window.  Now it hooks into the window which adds hooks to each web-page.

I also found a bug that used extra memory when it didn't need to.  That may help some people too.

Ciao!

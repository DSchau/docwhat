If you can send me your TWiki or a TWiki that reproduces the problem (maybe the same version), I'll take a look.

Alternatively, you can try disabling various plugins to verify that it's IAT and not something else.

I have a version that hooks into the page in a different way that I wan to release soon and maybe that'll fix the problem. :-/

Ciao!

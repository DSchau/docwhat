Hey, I'm sure you've probably heard this before, but on the offchance that you haven't... WHERE'S THE HOTKEY SUPPORT?  I mean really a solid product but the whole appeal of using an external editor (I'm particularly thinking of VIM here) is that you can use all sorts of keyboard shortcuts.  I.E. you don't have to use your mouse.  If you could add some sort of hotkey to open up the text editor intstead of requiring you to hit a button... I don't know... you could change the world man!  :)  Hope this is possible and thanks for an awesome extension.

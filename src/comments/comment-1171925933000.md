Docwhat:
I cannot try your suggestion to point It's All Text to /Application/.app/Contents/MacOS/ because the Editor field in Preferences is not editable (and you can't peak into packages with Browse). SI've found the file with the defaults prefs for It's All Text, but I cannot find the file with the current setting. Can you please tell the location of the prefs file?

Thanks
Lieven

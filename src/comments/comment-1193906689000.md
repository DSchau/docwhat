Recently when I edit a complex form *without* IAT I have noticed that it will jump up to the beginning of the form every once in a while.  This also tends to result in weird cursor problems (disappearing text cursor, mostly).

I'm wondering if this might be related to IAT, since I think it started around the time I upgraded to 0.8.1 from some 0.7 or 0.6 series release.

Upgrading to 0.8.2 now BTW.

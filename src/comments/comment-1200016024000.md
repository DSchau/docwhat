re: Jenkins

Hello!  Thanks for the positive.

I've been busy/tired/etc. of late.  Between my new house, getting used to my new laptop  and all the end of year festivities, etc. I have been busy.

Heck, I haven't even gotten IAT to work on my laptop yet! *gasp*  Of course, I mean I haven't gotten my new latest-greatest version.

You can download the source from my <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/" rel="nofollow">Mercurial</a> repository at <a href="http://hg.gerf.org/itsalltext/" rel="nofollow">http://hg.gerf.org/itsalltext/</a>.

You'll want to use the latest release tag to make changes against.  You can try it from trunk, but I don't think it works at the moment. :-(

Thanks again for the warm fuzzies. :-)

Ciao!

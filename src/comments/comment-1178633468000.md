Jacques:

I wasn't very clear.  The way TinyMCE works is that it marks the textarea as display:none.  IAT should remove the edit button when that happens.  In order to make IAT work with TinyMCE, it'll have to be able to identify TinyMCE, then it'll have to force save the TinyMCE back to the textarea (the textarea isn't updated until the form is submitted, normally).  Open your editor.  Whenever your file changes, it would have to update the textarea, then force TinyMCE to re-update from the textarea.

I probably won't be adding this functionality into IAT, but I have an idea for an API on web pages which would let the author of the page add this functionality.  It's definitely a post 1.0 thing.

Ciao!

They have a workaround on the SourceForge site:

http://alexandria.wiki.sourceforge.net/OpenID#tocOpenID5

Adding the HTML discovery they mention allows delegation to work for me. But even that is partly broken. It requires me to include the "www" and "index.html" portion of my URL, which I normally leave out. But the whole thing is almost useless anyway, since you can't use it for their CVS or Subversion.

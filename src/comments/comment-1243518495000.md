Interesting.  I'm using the 3.5b4 and I haven't really noticed this.

Some questions:
<ul>
	<li>What OS are you using?</li>
        <li>When you say focus on click, do you mean the whole browser or just when focusing for TEXTAREAs?  The two times that IAT does something is:
        <ol>
            <li>When you mouse over or click a TEXTAREA.</li>
            <li>When you change the tab.</li>
        </ol>
</li></ul>

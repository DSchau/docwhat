I'm on Windows XP and want to edit my textareas using gvim _with_ commandline options.

So I created a .cmd file as per the instruction in your FAQ. When I try to select the editor in the Preferences window (Browse) I get a regular 'Open File' dialogue with the filetype set to 'Application'. Sadly, .cmd files are not shown with this filetype (and there are no other choices for filetype) so there is no way to select the command file I created. I only see all *.exe files.

The workaround is to type the filename of the .cmd file (with extension) literally into the filename field.

Maybe you could add that hint to your FAQ or fix the filetype so that files with the .cmd extension are also visible. Great extension btw! :)

Cheers,
Torsten

Sideremark:
I put the following into the .cmd file to open the textarea for editing in a new tab in an existing Vim window (requires Vim 7):
[code lang="shell" light="true"]C:\path\to\vim\executable\gvim.exe -p --remote-tab-silent %1[/code]

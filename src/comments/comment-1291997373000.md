I have several reasons:
<ul>
<li>The editor control is tough</li>
<li>The amount of effort to keep the complicated execution and refresh checking code working as FF updates is annoying.</li>
<li>Cross platform compatibility for the editor portion is tough.</li>
<li>I want IAT to work on chrome and other browsers.</li>
<li>IAT is too complicated</li>
</ul>

For me, as a developer, this is worthwhile.  I'm just uncertain if the gains are worth it for the users of IAT.

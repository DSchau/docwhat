This is a very useful extension, and I can think of one small thing that would make it even more useful for me.  Your button will open NaturallySpeaking, but if I dictate into DragonPad the contents are not then saved to the text box.  It is a small matter since I can save the text and paste it, but it would be great if your program could do it.

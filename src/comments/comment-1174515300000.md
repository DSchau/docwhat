Christian,

Thank you so much for this - I have it running beautifully on my
MacBook Pro, with Firefox 2.0.0.3 and Aquamacs, and am using it to
type this message :-) I couldn't figure out how to get Darwin Emacs to
work, but Aquamacs worked first time. Thanks also to Hugh for nice
clear instructions on how to make that work.

@prasun:  Hmmm.... I am able to get it to work using the string below. gmail.com is correctly set for UTF-8.

I think the problem must be your editor.  It must not be saving as UTF-8.  Perhaps it is using one of the other charsets for saving?  If you know what charset it is using then you can set it in the preferences. Alternatively you can get your editor to save in UTF-8.

I know some of the non-arabic speakers use non-unicode charsets because they are rather verbose.  If Firefox understands that charset, it should be able to convert it correctly to UTF-8.

Example:
<blockquote>
Hindi: मैं काँच खा सकता हूँ, मुझे उस से कोई पीडा नहीं होती.
</blockquote>

I don't know what it says, but it is pretty. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/utf8.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>

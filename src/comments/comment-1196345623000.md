Rafael Pi:

There is a <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets" rel="nofollow">list of IANA registered character sets</a>.  It contains about 254 character sets.  

I haven't added it because I'm lazy, most users (except English windows users) know "their" character set, the list is long, and most users wouldn't know how to pick their character set out of the list.

But I'll probably do it, eventually.  Right now though, I need my new laptop to arrive and to pry my hard-drive out of my old one and recover the work I did on redesigning the monitor/watcher in IAT.

Ciao!

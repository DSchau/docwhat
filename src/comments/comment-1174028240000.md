Too get this working in MacOS X, I had to make a symlink to my editor (in my case emacsclient), then I browsed to the symlink and selected in the "It's All Text!" preferences.

For example, in Terminal I found the emacsclient program in /Applications/Aquamacs Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient and made a link like this:

$ cd ~
$ ln -s /Applications/Aquamacs Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient .

Then I switched to Firefox and selected Tools -&gt; Add-Ons, then selected "It's All Text" and clicked Preferences, then clicked Browse and selected the emacsclient link in my Home directory.

You can substitute any editior for emacsclient.

While I appreciate the efforts of services like 41Pounds and GreenDimes, I can't help but feel that they're more bandaid than cure. What we need is a national Do Not Mail registry, similar to the wildly popular Do Not Call registry that Congress instituted in 2003.

I'm about to launch a grassroots campaign that involves sending thousands of boxes of junk mail to Capitol Hill. With enough people participating, we can convince Congress to stop unwanted junk mail once and for all.

Update: After closing and opening Firefox at least 3 times, the "It's All Text!" extension is now functioning. Very odd. All of a sudden it started working on my profile with all of the other add-ons enabled. It took at least 3 complete cycles of closing and relaunching FF (giving appropriate time between each one) to get this to work.

On this note, I think this is relevant: The other preferences were not being applied when this didn't work. For example, the position of the Edit button (I moved it to the top left) would not save when the editor launch issue wasn't working.

Therefore, I think this might have something to do with It's All Text not saving preferences correctly until much later (after multiple restarts of Firefox).

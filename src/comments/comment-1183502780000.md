Hi there, Sammy-

I assure you that we are not running a scam and would encourage you to spend some time on our website. After that, if there are any additional questions I can help clear up for you, I am more than happy to do so.

I would also like to comment on the www.stopglobalwarming.org issue you bring up. 4info began supporting StopGlobalWarming in 2005, long before GreenDimes existed- which is beside the point. We are happy for everyone to work on reducing junk mail together. In case you are interested in reading more about their work together, here is a link to the press release from July, 2005:

It is indeed a small world, and one that we are very interested in making a better place. So thank you for taking interest in stopping your junk mail and please let me know if there is anything I can help you out with.

Take good care,

Kendra
GreenDimes

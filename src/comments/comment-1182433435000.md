I'm not quite sure about your window.addEventListener( "unload", ... that.monitor.unwatch( event.originalTarget||document ); ... ) , because windows "unload" event is fired in a rather strange (for me) way, probably related to caching. AFAIK, it is not fired on every page you leave, so many event listeners can remain registered and leak memory.

But I'm all except a guru of memory leaks:)

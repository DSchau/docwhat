Yan:

Hmm....  I use gmail and haven't had any trouble.  It does take a moment to appear (because the textarea appears and it takes up to 7 seconds or so to appear.

Can you do me a favor and try it this way....
<ol>
<li> log out of gmail </li>
<li> Go to Tools -&gt; Addons -&gt; It's All Text! and pick preferences. </li>
<li> Set the refresh rate to 3 seconds and close the preferences. </li>
<li> Shut down your browser. </li>
<li> Open up the browser. </li>
<li> Login to gmail. </li>
<li> Press Compose Message. </li>
<li> Move the mouse over the compose text area. </li>
<li> The button may not appear right away. Wait 30 seconds, just to make sure. It should, <em>at most,</em> take 6 seconds to appear. </li>
</ol>

Thanks.

If it does show up, then I think I need to set the default refresh rate lower. :-/

Ciao!

I've been studying the art of sourdough and making sourdough bread for years and I'm sorry but you've got just about everything wrong here.  If this is an elaborate joke to make people waste flour and time I can understand then, if it's not then I recommend anyone interested in actually making sourdough bread go here:

The bit about baking soda being the sour part is particularly funny since it's quite the opposite.  Feeding a sourdough with anything but flour is a recipe for really bad bread.

A proper sourdough starter should never have anything in it but flour and water.  Nothing else is required.  Flour has natural sourdough yeasts and the bacteria required to generate the lactic acid required for the sour taste.  Adding store bought yeast just forces all the yeast you want to compete with the natural yeasts, this is very wrong on so many levels.  The link above will steer you straight.

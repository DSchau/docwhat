Hiya Linda!

Never heard of such a thing as using potato flakes. But a starch is
a starch.

The rules above are about the care of the yeast organism. If you use
potato flakes you would only be changing the food. I don't know how
much change it'll make in the starter and how much change it'd make
in the bread you make.

It would be interesting to try. I don't know if you could totally
replace the flour or not. You'd have to make sure that the flakes
are only potato and not something that'll kill the yeasts.

You could start with the recipe above but when you go to add more
flour, use flakes instead. If the yeast continues, then you have
success!

Ciao!

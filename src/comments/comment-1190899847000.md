Fan:

Do you mean, the file in the editor would be updated from the browser window?  That is, it would be synchronized in both directions?

What happens when a change in the browser conflicts with a change in the editor?

If one (the editor or the browser) was given priority, then it's not so hard.

Do you have a use case?

Ciao!

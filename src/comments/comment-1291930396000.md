Cool!

I've actually worked hard at keeping my code readable.  I was "insulted" by another student in college when she looked over my shoulder and said something to the effect that a child could read it.  She meant to be mean, since I wasn't use cool language tricks to make it hard to read....but I figured out that what I was doing was making the code easy to read, which made my life easier.

Ciao!

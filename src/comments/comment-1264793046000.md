<cite>"It only works in FF3.6, but the statistics show that the users of It’s All Text! upgrade their browser almost immediately after a new version comes out, so I’m not worried."</cite>

How much trouble might it be to make it compatible with the current "devel" branch of Firefox (3.7)?  I <em>love</em>  IAT and would be very happy to be using it with 3.7!

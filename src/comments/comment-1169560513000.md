Hi,

I like your plugin very much (I use MozEx at the moment). 
Thanks for offering it.
It works fine, but your plugin does not 
support special characters f.e. german umlaute (üöä) or the euro sign (€).
(FF 2.0, WinXP Professional)
With my preferred editor Boxer I get strange characters instead of Umlaute,
with Notepad.exe I get the Umlaute but not the newline.

Beste regards
Christian

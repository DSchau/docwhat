For IAT ver0.6.8 on MacOSX, setting "Editor" parameter to "/usr/bin/open", which may be the default setting for IAT ver0.6.8, enebles you to open the default editor for .txt files.(It may be TextEdit.app if you haven't change the quota).
You can launch any editor you want by changing the default editor for .txt files.
It could be a workaround.

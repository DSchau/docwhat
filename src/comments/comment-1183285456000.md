GreenDimes.com - It looks like you all are running the scam yourselves. I have been a proud member of 41pounds.org for months now, and YES, I am really happy with their services. Why are you picking on them so much?
Laurie David of www.StopGlobalWarming.org is FULLY supporting this company. She wouldn't have gotten involved unless she knew what she was doing...right!
I see you have Matt Damon on your Board of Directors. Good job! I hope he researched your company before getting involved with it. By the way, your CEO, Pankaj Shah, used to be with 4Info... correct? I now see that 4Info is sponsoring www.StopGlobalwarming.org, your 41pounds.org competitor. I guess it really is a small world.

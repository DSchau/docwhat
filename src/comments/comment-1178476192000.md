Jacques:

Thanks!  The behavior that you should be seeing on a TinyMCE textarea is that there should be *no* button.  This is because TinyMCE hides the textarea and edits inside a div or something like that.  In theory (haven't tried it) you should be able to hit the edit html button which pops up a window with a text area in it.  That should be editable via IAT.

I'll take a look at it, but I'm guessing that to make such a page work reliably with something like IAT, it'll require changing the way the page works if it detects IAT (which there isn't currently a way to do, though I got some excellent suggestions from someone for a post-1.0 change. )  :-)

Ciao!

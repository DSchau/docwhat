Hi and thanks for your work!

I want to report a problem that I believe has shown up since a recent upgrade.  When the hokey setting is set to its default (none), the AltGr key on my Norwegian keyboard works as a hotkey, which is quite annoying as it is used as a compound key needed to input common characters (@£$«»~ and so on). If I change the hotkey to something else (like F2), the AltGr key no longer functions as a hotkey and I can easily input such characters in the default text field without invoking the external editor.

Easy to work around so no big problem for me, thought I'd let you know though.

Tore

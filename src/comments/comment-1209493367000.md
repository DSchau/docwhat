Regarding the bug with file name uniqueness (http://docwhat.gerf.org/2007/10/its-all-text-v080/#comment-3946)

I have also run into this issue with editing &gt; 1 text area in a single "domain".  We're using DokuWiki, and all editing takes place in "http://www.domain.com/wiki/doku.php", so if the "random bit" on the end of the file name (www.domain.com.2p2if12e1i.txt) is based solely off of the URL, then this would be why there are collisions.  I'm not sure if there is any other information you can grok from the page to add to the uniqueness, as my web development is limited at best.

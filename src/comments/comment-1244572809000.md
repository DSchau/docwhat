For Debian Lenny I needed to just add the lines in network-bridge-custom like this exactly :) :-

#!/bin/sh
dir=$(dirname "$0")
"$dir/network-bridge" "$@" netdev=eth0
"$dir/network-bridge" "$@" netdev=eth1
"$dir/network-bridge" "$@" netdev=eth2

Now all my routes is good. In the vm.cfg just use ethX and not xenbro :) and the dom0 is accessible from all interfaces so your ifup script is helpful to isolate only one interface.

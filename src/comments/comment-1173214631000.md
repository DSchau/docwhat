This extension absolutely rules. I had an extension which allowed me to resize textareas, but it didn't always work right. This just works.

If I may propose a feature request. Today I was working on a website and the layout was kind of blown out. I switched over to safe mode and the layout was fine. Turns out the "edit" graphic was off to the side about 300 pixels from the textarea causing the layout issue.

Perhaps you could implement a toggle. Where I could switch it off temporarily while I test websites and then back on when I need it. That would so very much rock!

Thanks, and keep up the good work.

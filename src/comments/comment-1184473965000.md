TommyB:

I took a look at it, and what's going on is:

<ol>
  <li>IFE (InFormEnter) determines that the next sibling to the textarea is not an IFE button and creates a button immediately after the textarea.
  </li>
  <li>IAT creates the button immediately after the textarea, pushing the IFE button away from the textarea making the second sibling.</li>
  <li>IFE determines that the next sibling to the textarea is not an IFE button (it's the IAT button) and creates a button immediately after the textarea.</li>
  <li>IAT doesn't care where the button is once it has been created, and does nothing.</li>
</ol>

I cannot really detect this situation in IAT.  IFE needs to figure out that the button is already created and not create another one.

I have written an email to the author of IFE.

Ciao!

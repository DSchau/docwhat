(Firefox 2.0.0.8 | It's All Text! 0.8.2 | Win XP SP2)

I just installed it, and opened the readme page. I then clicked the edit button, and it told me to set the editor. I clicked the Preferences button and set it (Notepad++ 4.5). I tried again, and it told me to set the editor (again). I then set it to notepad. It opened notepad, but after I closed it, the tab went blank (not to the standard BG color, but absolutely blank, and it will not close or open another URL. I set the editor back to N++, and it works now. However, there are two major bugs:
1. Setting N++ as the editor didn't work in that tab, but notepad did. That is very strange.
2. There is now a tab I cannot close without closing the window.

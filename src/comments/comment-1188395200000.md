Boudewijn Pelt:

Oooh....that'll be a hard one to fix.  The work around is to use the keyboard:

<ol>
  <li>Click on the text box.</li>
  <li>Press <tt>tab</tt> once to get to the checkbox.</li>
  <li>Press <tt>space</tt> to check the box.</li>
</ol>

I'll see if I can work up a test case for it.  But detecting that a checkbox is below the button is hard. :-/  In addition, the button is in the wrong place for some reason.  I'll have to look at the DOM to see what's going on.

Thanks for reporting this.

Ciao!

Hello, I am using this extension on my Windows XP system.
I have a new feature request - a list of URLs (regex) for which It's All Text will be *disabled*

There is a certain web page I use which puts a link exactly where the IAT "edit" button appears. There is about a 2 pixel difference, and it's hard to click the link on the web page. In this case, I don't care if IAT isn't applicable for this page.

Is there a way to disable IAT for a given URL (regex) ?

Thanks - Steven

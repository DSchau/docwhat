@Hans:
   Thanks for pointing that out.  I don't know *why* I was trying to position it from the page edge instead of the parent node edge.  I think I just got into this zone of frustration where I went nuts.  *sigh*  It'll be fixed in the next version.

To all those who pointed out the gumdrop edit button was in the wrong place:
  Thanks reporting the edit button being off.  It's fixed currently and should be fixed in any version > 0.4.2

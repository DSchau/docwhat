There is a bug with this.  It doesn't fix Command-W.  This seems to be because setting ',' requires using a different technique.

Here's what osxkeys.el uses to set customize (preferences):
[code]
(define-key map (vector (list osxkeys-command-key '\,) ) 'customize)
[/code]

I've added a little patch for this in the function <code>fix()</code>:
[code]
            # Patches problem with the customize.
            if line.strip() == &quot;&quot;&quot;(define-key map (vector (list osxkeys-command-key '\,) ) 'customize)&quot;&quot;&quot;:
                rows[i] = line.replace(&quot;'customize&quot;, &quot;'close-window&quot;)
                continue
[/code]

firefox_fan:  I don't know anything about BBCodeWriter, but it looks like it isn't a normal editor.  I'm guessing that it doesn't accept a filename as the first argument when run.

Try creating a text file and then running BBCodeWriter with the argument being that text file from a cmd.com command line.

Ciao!

Alex:

Yeah, this is a problem.

I'm thinking about making the button disappear when the mouse isn't over a textarea and the textarea isn't in focus.

So in your case, you just click outside the textarea someplace (to remove the focus) and the edit button goes away entirely, leaving you free to click the button underneath.

Ciao!

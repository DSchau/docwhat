I tried to post once but I don't think it worked; if both show up, please delete the other one.

@docwhat
I really appreciate the quick reply.  Thanks!

After adding the %1 to fix the most salient issue, I resolved the multiple-instance problem by adding the -reuseview switch to the startup command, i.e.

"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "C:\Program Files\jEdit\jedit.jar" <b>-reuseview</b> %1

It now works like a dream and will make my work with <a href="http://www.modxcms.com" rel="nofollow">MODx</a> (where your plugin is highly recommended) much easier!

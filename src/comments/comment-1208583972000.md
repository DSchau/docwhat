I've recently encountered a problem.  I've emerged firefox 3.0b5 on Gentoo, and configured It's All Text to use "<code>/usr/bin/emacsclient --alternate-editor=emacs</code>" for my editor.  Until just recently this worked fine, but after a recent rebuild of firefox (which might've been the update to b5) I've begun getting the error "Unable to open your editor" for the reason "The path ... does not exist."  I've double-checked the command from my shell, and know the command does work.

Is this a bug in It's All Text, or Firefox 3 beta, or am I missing something?

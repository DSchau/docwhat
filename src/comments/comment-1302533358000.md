Hi,

I tried to figure out what codepage sets are supported but can't find any information about it.

I need to use Win32pad for specific reasons, but Win32pad doesn't support UTF-8. Therefore, which character set would I have to use in It's All Text in order for it to work correctly with Win32pad (including German Umlauts)?

Thanks already heaps for help,
David.P

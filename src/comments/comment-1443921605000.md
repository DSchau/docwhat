There some tools available now which helps people install docker on mac &amp; windows e.g boot2docker
Check out vagrant. It's a full VM that you write a recipe for it to automatically install the applications in that recipe, if in for example you messed up with your VM i.e: <code>$rm -rf /etc</code> then you can easily destroy the VM and rebuild again

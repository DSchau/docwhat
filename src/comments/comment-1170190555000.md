Could this add a couple of options:

1) To put emacs into wiki-mode, it'd be nice to have an association of sites to extensions (maybe this is asking for a lot?).
1a) alternatively, could the right-click menu for it's all text bring up the option to add an extension or have a pre-configured profile or something that's selectable?

2) Is it posslbe to add flags to the editor? Somtimes I like to use emacsclient with a failback to running emacs in case I don't have an emacs server running yet.

Otherwise, this is fantastic! Thanks,

-Peter

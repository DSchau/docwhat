docwhat, thanks for your response of 2007-07-12.  I downloaded wget and looked at what content our server was returning in response to the different queries.  Up to the end of the first section, there was nothing different between what was returned for the query "http://our.internal.wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_article_in_question&amp;action=edit" and "http://our.internal.wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_article_in_question&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1", but when I give these URLs to the browser, the first one results in the popup I described being displayed, while the second one works normally, bringing up an edit box for the section.

By the way, soon after I reported that this works normally in IE, it started misbehaving there, too.  If I try the first URL, IE pops up a dialog that says "Do you want to save this file, or find a program online to open it?"

Since others in my office do not have this problem, I think that I've somehow broken the setup of my computer.  I do remember playing about with Registry settings in an attempt to make the .php problem go away.

In any case, I'm now pretty sure it's not a problem with IAT.

Thanks for posting your script for Mac OS above, docwhat!

It works for me. To open my emacs, I just create a script called /usr/bin/start-emacs with the following content and put /usr/bin/start-emacs in the "Editor" preference in "It's all text". Here is the script content:

 #!/bin/sh

 if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
   touch "$1"
 fi

 exec open -a /Applications/Emacs.app "$1"

Instead of using the script one could also just use "open" as editor application in the "it's all text" preferences, but that opens TextEditor on my system, and I don't know how to change the default editor to Emacs.

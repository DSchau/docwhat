Guillem:

Another suggestion, actually.... You can use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108" rel="nofollow">Stylish</a> to make the textarea's visible (and set them very small, if you want to avoid them ruining the layout) and allow IAT to edit them.

Tell me which one would work. I'm obviously in favor of you using stylish, because I'm lazy.  But it wouldn't be that hard to add a way to flip back to the previous behavior.

Ciao!

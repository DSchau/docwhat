Ok. I see what you mean. The first comment does not have the Post button blocked.
But then the "Defect" checkbox is blocked. 

Login on the review site. http://demo.cenqua.com/cru/CR-11
Click "/trunk/libgaim/example/nullclientc"
Click line 17.
type some text.
Click the Defect checkbox: it does not work, the checkbox is blocked.
But you can still click on the "Defect" text.
Click "Post"
Click "Reply"
Type some text.
Now the "Post" button is blocked.

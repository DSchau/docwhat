What are the current options in the [Character Set] field in the [Preferences] dialog? I'll rephrase: Is there really, really no hope for us people married to an editor with no Unicode support, like NoteTab Light (Windows ANSI only)? I would love to be able to use IAT without being forced to switch away from my every day editor (which kind of kills the concept, doesn't it?). Anyway, thank you very much for all your work and responsiveness; best regards.

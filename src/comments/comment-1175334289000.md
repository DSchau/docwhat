Erm, they're not the same, otherwise I'd have used the simpler $ ... although it's probably overkill to be correct when it's all just a file name after all.  But for the record, $ means "end of line" (i.e. any newline will match, or whatever is the line ending convention in the context) whereas \' matches only on the end of the entire thing -- say, a buffer with many lines in it, or a narrowed region, or whatever (and the doubled backslash is in practice needed when you put it in a snippet of elisp, but the actual regex is still just \' so that's what you'd use e.g. in an interactive search, like esc ctrl-s).

I figured this didn't need to be quite as general as I'd have liked to make it, and it's a hassle to put in a full path, but I appreciate that some people (such as probably only you) would have multiple directories with the same name.  That's easy to fix, and I suppose you might as well fix it for everyone: make the regular expression match the full path (i.e. something like "\\\\`/home/[^/]*/\\\\.mozilla/firefox/[^/]*/itsalltext/[^/]*\\\\.txt\\\\'" ... and I hope I got all the sufficient amounts of backslashes this time).

trac.gerf.org doesn't resolve for me at the moment, is the link to filetypes.el correct?

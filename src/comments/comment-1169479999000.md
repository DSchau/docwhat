Matt:

Thanks for taking the time to report the problem (and the text typo).

I suspect that you are trying to run the .app file from the Application directory.  On MacOSX, you need to use the binary that the editor placed in /usr/bin.  Alternatively, you can look in the /Application/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/MacOS/ for an executable.  Usually the name of the executable is &lt;name&gt;, matching the .app directory name.  However, not always.

This is one of the really annoying parts of MacOSX.  I haven't come up with a good solution.  I think I'll update the text to include this information for the next version.

If that doesn't fix your problems, then I'll have to borrow a Mac and see if I can reproduce the problem.

In general, I'd appreciate anyone's help on this, since I don't use Macs.

Thanks again!

Ciao!

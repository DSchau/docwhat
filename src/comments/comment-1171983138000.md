Lieven:
  Sorry.  I don't have a Mac, so I couldn't check it out the advice with regards to the file picker.  All browser preferences are kept in prefs.js in your firefox profile directory.  They are not kept in the extension directory (which is what you found, I think).

Most editors now days include an executable in /usr/bin/ for running the editor externally.  What editor are you using that doesn't have this?

Ciao!

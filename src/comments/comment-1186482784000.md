Hi,
Like the plug-in, but is not quite what I am looking for.
A common problem with text entry fields is that you get an error the moment you submit.

But with this plug-in, if you press the edit button again you still loose the text you typed.
The specific case I am talking about is adding comments using the Jira bug tracker from www.atlassian.com.

A solution would be not to replace an existing temporary file by an empty one. Just open the existing one.
You can always clear it in the editor you are using.

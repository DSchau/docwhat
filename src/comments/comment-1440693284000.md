Well, I don't work for any of these companies, or know anyone who does, so what you are about to read here is the honest experience of an average consumer.  I happened upon a link to 41pounds.org on another website, and the concept sounded good to me.  I consider my time to be worth money, so to me it was worth $41 to have someone else do the legwork and all I had to do was sign a few postcards.  I never did receive those postcards, but about 24 hours after signing up, I did receive a fraud alert from my bank indicating suspicious charges on my card.  Sure enough, my card had been used on a few websites, including an attempted money transfer on Western Union.  Fortunately my bank is on the ball, and only one of these charges was approved; the others were halted, and the one that went through was refunded to me.  I am not necessarily accusing anyone at 41pounds.org of fraudulent activity; perhaps it is simply that the security on their website needs improvement.  This was a relatively new card, which I picked up directly from the bank and had not used for any other online purchases at the time, so I am confident the fraud was the result of using my card on the 41pounds.org website.  And... I never did get those postcards.

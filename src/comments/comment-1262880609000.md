I like itsalltext a lot, but it delivers a nasty performance hit to facebook (see ticket 74 -- http://trac.gerf.org/itsalltext/ticket/74).  My browser seems considerably more responsive, and consumes much less CPU when nothing is otherwise going on, once I disabled it, and profiles generated with XUL Profiler look a lot cleaner, too.

As best as I can figure, it has something aggressively looking for text areas, but I haven't tried really diving into it.

I'll probably play with the colors some going forward.  I like colors too much. :-)

As a friend pointed out to me, the new layout has that nice "simple" aesthetic that is pretty pleasing.

However, it still doesn't feel "finished" or "polished" some how.  Not sure.

The white does let me have a nice clean "whitespace" look though.  I'll probably tone down the blue, though.

Ciao!

I like the idea of using $EDITOR or percent-EDITOR-percent in Windows.  It won't make the extension smaller. It'll probably make it bigger, actually.

I can make the extension smaller on disk.  It currently takes 112k.  If I put the chrome/contents directory in a jar, then that'll reduce it further to 68k on disk.  24k is just the size of the extension downloaded.

However, I don't want to write a build optimization phase into my makefile until I'm done testing.  I'll add it to my todo list.

Are you working on an embedded platform that you are counting kilobytes?

Ciao!

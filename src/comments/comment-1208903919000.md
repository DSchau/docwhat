Hi, Christian. I could use some help.

I believe that I've followed all the instructions and yet I can't get It's All Text to launch the editor of my choice.

The setup:
Mac OS X 10.5.2
Firefox 2.0.0.14
It's All Text 0.8.4

Shell script:
<blockquote>#!/bin/sh
# This is an example shell script for It's All Text!

open -a /Applications/TextMate.app "$@"</blockquote>

Editor preference set to:
/Users/aangel/Applications/ItsAllText/iat.sh

Result of ls -l:
<blockquote>-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 aangel  staff  103 Apr 22 15:32 iat.sh</blockquote>

All directories leading to the shell script have -x.

If I empty the editor preference textbox, it loads using TextEdit with no trouble.

What could I be missing?

Thanks,
Andre'

To give Kendra and Margot credit:  They are not using a sales template, or if they are it is heavily customized to the point where I cannot find similar posts.

That alone would be a reason to like and trust them (and maybe their organization) more than  Debbie (and her organization).

It's the people &mdash; the personal touch &mdash; that makes a company.  Good people rarely stay at bad organizations.  If they do, they usually act like their company.  If you spot good people, it usually is a good sign.

Ciao!

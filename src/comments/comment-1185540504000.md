Yeah, the context menu seems to be, in part, a bug in Mozilla.  I'm tracking those bugs and hopefully it'll be fixed some day. :-/

<ul><li>Bug #<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=287357"  rel="nofollow">287357</a></li><li>Bug #<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=362403"  rel="nofollow">362403</a></li><li>Bug #<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279703"  rel="nofollow">279703</a></li></ul>

Meanwhile, the next version I release will have the "best version" of the context menu possible with Mozilla in it's current state.

Unfortunately, I have introduced memory leaks in my current tree so I've been trying to fix those.  Added to, real-life has been a little busy.  So I haven't spent much time on this.

Sorry. :-(

I'll see if I can make some time this weekend.

Ciao!

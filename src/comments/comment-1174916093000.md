Hugh:

Hi!  Thanks for trying it out.  I'll take a look at gmail again. :-/  I've had a strange bug where in the wordpress admin screen the button won't show up <em>sometimes</em>.  It's very strange.

I knew about the Mac OS X problem but have been having a hard time searching for what the problem is.  Obviously, I must be using an incorrect call to openDialog().  Your information should help me narrow that down.

Thanks again for the feedback.

Ciao!

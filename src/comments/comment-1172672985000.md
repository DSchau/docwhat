@vikas: You're the second person to ask.  I honestly don't know what's needed to make it work in Thunderbird.  I think I want to make this work as well as possible in Firefox first.

@codemac:
It's All Text! only sends the filename.  I definitely don't send the words "visible-stats on".  Is it possible that you have a weird alias, or some sort of setting in your .vimrc?  Otherwise, I'm not sure what it could be, since it works for everyone else.

I guess I'd suggest starting with basic principles, like 
<code>echo "$@" > /tmp/testing</code> and work your way up.  I assume you tried running your script directly...

Ciao!

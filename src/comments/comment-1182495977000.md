Hi Christian,

what about Thunderbird?
I use It's All Text all day. But recently I started using Thunderbird instead of Webmail. There is an Extension similar to It's All Text for Thunderbird called External Editor (http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=2) but it is not that good.
Would it be much work to transfer It's All Text to Thunderbird?

Thanks for this wonderfull application.
Best regards
Christian

v1.4 will NOT install on Firefox 3.5.7 -- I just tried it again following the "IAT page on AMO" you provided. I get the same result when the FF Extension Manager tries to update it -- namely the following error message is displayed "It's All Text! 1.4 could not be installed because it is not compatible with Firefox 3.5.7.".

Something with the version checking isn't right.

I use "It's all text 0.8.2".  It's great - my deep appreciation to
docwhat for this nice piece of work!

I do however have one problem.  I use "It's all text" to configure
Firefox to open a text editor editing *.txt files.  My favorite editor
is vim.

My problem is that I can get a WIN32-executable version of
vim to work okay, but I cannot use a DOS batch file to call
my Cygwin version of vim.  When I associate E:\u\config\text.bat
(see below) with TXT files, then click on a TXT file, I am 
getting a message in vim:
[code]
    C:Documents [New file]
[/code]
It seems clear that the batch file is passing argument 1 as a 
filename starting with "C:\Documents and Settings" -- a directory
that I never use for editing files.

In other words, it looks to me like the name of the file to be 
edited is being passed on correctly to the WIN32-executable 
version of vim, but something funny happens when "It's all text"
runs a DOS batch file.  Can anyone advise on this?

[code]
e:/u/config/text.bat

    @echo off

    c:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe -i e:\u\config\text.sh &quot;%1&quot;
[/code]

<hr />
[code]
e:/u/config/text.sh

    echo &quot;Loading minimal profile, then opening &quot;
    source /cygdrive/e/u/config/bash-profile-minimal
    vim &quot;$1&quot;
[/code]

Problem solved (I hope this is useful for someone):

I just had to enter "Windows-1250" in the [Character Set] field in the [Preferences] dialog in order to make IAT work with NoteTab Light 5.5. I had tried "Windows 1250" (without the hyphen), but IAT just ignored it. May I suggest a list or combo box with the «official» character set names (if there is such a thing) for dumb or lazy users like me?

Anyway, all seems to be dandy now. This extension is just great. Thank you very, very much again!

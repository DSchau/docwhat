"Some men are discovered" -- implies that men with some positive attribute are discovered. "Discovery" implies something positive.

"others are found out" -- "found out" implies that the subject was doing something in a concealed way.  Cheaters, for example, are "found out". 

It becomes humorous <del datetime="2011-04-14T16:31:12+00:00">since with the first part,</del> <ins datetime="2011-04-14T16:31:12+00:00">because</ins> it sets up a positive connotation in the first half, then sort of knocks it down in the second half.

Ciao!

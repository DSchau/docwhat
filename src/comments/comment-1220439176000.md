I found a solution similar to the one of Thomas Baker.

What I wanted is opening the Editor GVim under andLinux (since I already have andLinux installed). The problem arised was that the file name with the full path was passed, and I needed a different path for gvim, since under andLinux, I access to the files over a shared folder, so /mnt/win/... and not C:\\...

My solution is It's all Text calls a batch file called gvim.cmd, the content of this file is:

andcmd gvim /mnt/win/Dokumente\ und\ Einstellungen//Anwendungsdaten/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles//itsalltext/%~nx1 

This command uses a selfdefined path plus the filename without the path (%~nx1)

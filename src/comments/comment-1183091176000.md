Florin Andrei:

<b>re: refresh time set to 3 seconds.</b>

The reason is that it uses CPU time.  For each window open, it has a checker.  If you are using a desktop, having it run once a second isn't horrible.

If you run a laptop, setting this to 100 and waving the mouse over the textarea may be better; it'll use less power.

<b>re: .php extension</b>

No problem!  You can do it yourself! Go into the preferences <tt>Tools -&gt; It's All Text! -&gt; Preferences&hellip;</tt> and add the extension! :-)

Ciao!

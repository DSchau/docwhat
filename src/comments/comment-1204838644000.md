Nem:

Change works, but only if it had focus and then lost focus.

I think what you want is to use <code>addEventListener()</code> to listen for <code>DOMSubtreeModified</code> (if Firefox supports it).  If it doesn't, then I could see adding a hack into IAT to <code>dispatchEvent()</code> that event to make sure it works.

This will be ignored by all other browsers, assuming you check to make sure <code>addEventListener()</code> exists prior to using it. :-)

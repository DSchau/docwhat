FOR ALL MAC USERS:

It turns out that isExecutable() always returns false on Macs.  I have fixed this in version 0.6.4 or newer.

Status (updated on 2007-04-06): Waiting approval.  Till it is approved, you can <em style="text-decoration:line-through">download 0.6.4</em> from my site.

Ciao!

EDITED 2007-10-01: Removed link, since the file is no-longer there.

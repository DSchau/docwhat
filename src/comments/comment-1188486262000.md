Docwhat, first of all I want to thank you for this great extension!  I got
spoiled by years of using Lynx as my primary browser.  Lynx had an external
editor feature build in for quite a while, but I couldn't find a good graphical
browser with the same feature for a long time.  Since I am also a vi junkie, I
always end up inserting bunch of strange character combinations in textareas,
or loosing all typed text after accidentally pressing ESC. I have just
discovered tour extension and I can finally do what I used to do in the good
old Lynx days, edit textareas using vim. 

However, there is one thing missing for me.  I use the vimperator extension,
which lets me for most time do all my browsing with keyboard only, but there is
no way to start the external editor it It's all text! without a mouse.  I would
really really like to add my voice to the people asking for a hotkey support.
That would make It's all text! just perfect!

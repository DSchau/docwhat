OpenID should be fixed.  That was, as you point out, my bad.

I also found that Bad Behavior is messing with the ?openid_server=1 requests (they have a signature similar to cross site scripting attacks); so I disabled Bad Behavior for the moment.

However, SourceForge still isn't able to log in.  It says "Could not verify your OpenID. Please try again."  (after I've added it to my trusted sites, so it got that far)

The HTTP log only shows this:
<pre>
"GET /?openid_server=1&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fdocwhat.org%2Fauthor%2Fdocwhat%2F&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fdocwhat.org%2F&openid.assoc_handle=%7BHMAC-SHA256%7D%7B492c5dbe%7D%7BFUTq4w%3D%3D%7D&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Faccount%2Fopenid_verify.php&openid.realm=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net&openid.ns.sreg=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fextensions%2Fsreg%2F1.1&openid.sreg.optional=nickname%2Cemail%2Cfullname%2Ccountry%2Clanguage%2Ctimezone&openid.sreg.policy_url=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Ftos%2Fprivacy.php HTTP/1.0" 302 - "-"
</pre>

I use this wonderful extension all the time.  I often need to enter data
in multiple text boxes at the same time, so I would like to open up
(say) two editor windows at once.  Unfortunately I find that both
windows are editing the very same file.  So any change I make in one
editor shows up in BOTH text boxes.  I'm not sure how much control you
have over the name of the file you use, but it would be a big help if
you could make the file names more unique, to ensure that no two text
boxes use the same file name. 

Thanks for a great piece of software!

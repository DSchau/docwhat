Lulu:

If you create a non-text file, then you'll get non-text loaded to the web page.  These text boxes only handle "text".  If you try setting the fonts and colors, it won't work.  That is the nature of HTML and the web.

There are ways to work around this, but they depend on the authors of the *site* to do it.  A generic plug cannot do that, unless someone comes up with a standard.

I hope I'm clear.

Ciao!

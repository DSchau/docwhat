Hi Debbie!

How embarrassing.  It seems that your sales message is signed Tim, and that you aren't a founder!

I see the same message at

  <li>etc.</li>
</ol>

Anyway&hellip;

Do you have any images of your web interface?  How do you show your customers that you are doing what you say you are?

I had a specific concern, that someone with loose morals could create a junk-mail-stopping service and only do the minimal required, such as contacting ADVO and the DMA and pocket the rest of the money.

Ciao!

I was looking at the readme and I saw something that made me cringe, in the bit about how to get .app editors working on OSX:

    open -a /path/to/editor.app $*

$* is dangerous.  If there ever happens to be a shell metacharacter or white space in any of the arguments IAT passes to the editor, the script will not work; depending on what the text was, it might do something completely unexpected.  Now, the argument is under IAT's control, and you may know that it never passes in anything unsafe, but example shell scripts should always be coded defensively so that people absorb good coding habits.  Please change the readme so this line says instead

    open -a /path/to/editor.app "$@"

(Even this is not perfectly safe, but it's the best you can do as long as the "open" command doesn't support the special "--" argument, and as far as I can tell it doesn't.)

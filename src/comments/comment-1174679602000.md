They have rolled back to the older (working) addons site now.  So it's not an issue at the moment.  They had my extension in "the sandbox".  Which I think is a polite way of saying purgitory. If you disliked that experience as much as I did, then sign up for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=374406" rel="nofollow">bug 374406</a>. 

Remember to be polite.  They made a couple of bad choices, but they have worked really hard on this stuff.

Meanwhile...

   I posted (about 3 posts above) a temporary link to a newer version, since addons isn't accepting updates.

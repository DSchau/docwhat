Let me just say "thank you" for this.  I've been so hopelessly confused by various recipes I've read to do this, but I could follow yours and now have my ideal scenario up and running which has elluded me for three weeks now!

If it could be improved at all, I would perhaps spend those extra minutes and make up some more appropriate IP addresses as I found thinking of it that way made it easier to envisage which machines were on one network and which on another.

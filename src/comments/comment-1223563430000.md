I am having some difficulties getting this working on my OSX laptop (Firefox 3.0.1, OSX 10.4.1, It's All Text 0.8.5).  I created the shell script as suggested because I want to use /usr/bin/vi as my editor, set execute permission, configured the plugin to use the shell script, and restarted FF.  The result is that the edit button appears, but when I click on it, nothing happens.  If I try to run the 'exec /usr/bin/open -a ...' line in a shell (using Terminal), an error flashes quickly but I don't have time to read it before the terminal is terminated (ps doesn't show any odd detached processes).  Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can fix this?

@Nick Thompson:

That's a good idea!  I've added it as a <a href="http://trac.gerf.org/itsalltext/ticket/26" rel="nofollow">feature request</a> in <a href="http://trac.gerf.org/itsalltext" rel="nofollow">TRAC</a>.

I can't think of a work around to use until that event exists.  You could try the onchange, but telling the difference between a user and IAT will be hard if not impossible.

Ciao!

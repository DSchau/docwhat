Hi Christian,

Good name you have there (for everyone else's benefit, I'm not talking to myself).

I have added this to my todo list.  The code can handle chrome; I made that change so it works with stylish.  The biggest problem is figuring out where to put the buttons, etc. I can't make it work the way it does on web pages because XUL chrome is harder to manipulate without messing up the whole flow.

Ciao!

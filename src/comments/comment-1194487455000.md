Mike:

No, not at this time.  I have a GMail account, so I'll look at fixing it eventually.

However, right now I'm redoing the way the textareas are detected and how the refreshes happen.  As a side effect the following things should happen:

<ul>
  <li> It should use less memory (or allow memory to be garbage collected correctly). </li>
  <li> It will detect changes in the HTML markup right away. </li>
  <li> It should even detect changes that it currently misses (like GMail and Jira).</li>
</ul>

And it should make the code easier to work with.  The monitor portion is a hairy bit of code, the new stuff should be easier.

Ciao!

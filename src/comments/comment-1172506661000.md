@marc

I know about open.  However, 'open' isn't a UNIX command, it's only a MacOSX command. :-(  I couldn't figure out how to deal with it portably or even how to reliably detect MacOSX.

Anyway, you want your shell script to look like so:
[code lang="shell"]
#!/bin/sh
EDITOR=&quot;/Applications/Text/Smultron.app&quot;
open -a &quot;${EDITOR}&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
[/code]

Ciao!

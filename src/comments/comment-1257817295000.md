Never mind, I got it working.  In case someone else asks...

Under Carbon Emacs on the Mac, issue (server-start) inside Emacs,
e.g. from your Emacs initialize file, then in IAT set the editor to
/usr/bin/emacsclient.  That's all it takes!  I have also set up hotkeys
so with one keystroke I can jump from my Gmail compose window to a new
frame in an already-running Emacs, and with another keystroke, which
calls (server-done), I can jump back to my compose window with newly
edited text.

I love it!

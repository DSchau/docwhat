This methodology is great, IF the developer is still around to fix his code after a spectacular meltdown. Sadly, one of the more recent places I worked had had a developer create code by the Tandem method and only partly finish. Some things blew up spectacularly, some not at all, and regardless, there was no one with experience, tribal knowledge, or proper documentation to fix anything when it did. :(

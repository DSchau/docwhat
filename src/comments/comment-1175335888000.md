... Ah, so it's in the error console -- of course.  But it's way too verbose, because I have a large number of tabs open and I get "refreshing [URL]" for each of them, I guess once per second each?

Now when I click on "Preferences" I get the error dialog a second time /-:

I suppose my configuration is hosed.  Any chance you could add a pointer where to look and what a sane configuration should look like?

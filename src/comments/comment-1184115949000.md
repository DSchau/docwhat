Great extension. I use it to launch GVIM. Works fine with /usr/bin/open on Mac provided I specify GVIM as the application to open txt files. 

I have to say, though, that the lack of a keyboard shortcut to launch the desired text editor really cripples an otherwise brilliant add-on.

Nonetheless, thanks a million!

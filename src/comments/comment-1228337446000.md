Hey, one of the reasons I use ItsAllText is because the browser is
unreliable.  It might crash, it might lose my session and throw my text
away.

Unfortunately, ItsAllText doesn't really clean this up all the way.  If
ItsAllText hands the text back to the browser, and then the browser crashes,
ItSAllText has already deleted the data.

Can I disable the delete?  I'm perfectly capable of cronning a cleanup.

Hi! Would it be possible for you to create a spin-off that evaluates the $EDITOR environment-variable and only gives the button, or a text-area popup-menu in order to strip down the size of this add-on. While ca.20k might look small, as more extensions I install, the more I add ;-) And I really only need my $EDITOR (or %EDITOR% on Win32) (since that is, obviously, the editor I use all times).

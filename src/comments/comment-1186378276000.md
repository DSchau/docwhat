I found the solution to my problem.  It was nothing to do with It's All Text, any other Firefox plugin, the MIME types being served, or anything else to do with our web server.  The problem was that in my preferences for our internal wiki (which runs on MediaWiki software), in the "Editing" tab, I had "Use external editor by default" checked.  I didn't have that checked in my preferences for Wikipedia, so editing a whole page worked there.

I have no idea why I didn't get this error when editing a section of a page in our wiki, but after unchecking that box and saving my preferences, everything works.

One more thing: It's All Text is a great plugin!

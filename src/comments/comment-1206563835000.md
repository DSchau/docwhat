Well, it's not because of the versioning.  The version number says it should work with 3.0b5pre, which is the highest it can be set right now.

Just tried it out and it works for me.

Maybe there is a permissions problem on your Mac?  You can try the Disk Utility and ask it to verify permissions.

Maybe the JavaScript console will show you more about what has gone wrong?

Ciao!

As a temporary measure, until addons is back again  ...

<b>It's All Text!  Version 0.6.0</b>

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125" rel="nofollow">Get the latest at Addons</a>

I'll delete this comment once addons is back.

EDITED: I fixed the above URL.  Somehow it got an extra '/'. :-/
EDITED: A newer version is available on addons.

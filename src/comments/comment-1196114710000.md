Rafael Pi:

The current options are platform independent.  If you can find out what NoteTab Light's character set is, you can enter it and it (in theory) should work.

I'm not familiar with that editor, so I can't be much help.  I usually use <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">NOTEPAD++</a> when forced to use a Windows machine.

Ciao!

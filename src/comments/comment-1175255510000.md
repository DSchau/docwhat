Somehow the double backslashes in the elisp snippet were halved, I imagine by the stupid blog software.  But anyhow, any chance you could fix that, too?  The backslash before the apostrophe in the regexes (two identical places) should be double, like backslash backslash apostrophe double-quote.  (Emacs does regular string processing on regular expression strings just like any other string, so to get an actual backslash character through to the regular expression engine, you have to double it. The regular expression \' means "end of string" in Emacs.)

Thanks!

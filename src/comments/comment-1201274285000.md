@Dg.:

When you say XUL, you mean a Firefox application or extension?  Or do you mean something else?

Anyway, the problem is that with XUL it is much harder to insert the edit button and make it position correctly.  I'm sure it's possible, but I haven't sat down and done it.

At the moment, you can use the API I wrote for <a href="http://userstyles.org/stylish/" rel="nofollow">Stylish</a> to try to add an IAT button manually.  See: <a href="http://hg.gerf.org/itsalltext/file/9951df6d426c/src/chrome/content/API.js" rel="nofollow">API.js</a> in the extension folder.

Ciao!

Oleg:

You're probably right.  I have noticed something similar, though I work with HUGE web pages so in my case it's not necessarily a memory leak.

I have noticed though that while it gets up around 300M or so, it doesn't grow without bounds which implies that it just might be memory that Firefox doesn't like to recover.

I've been looking for problems.  Things I have tried include:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://dbaron.org/mozilla/leak-monitor/" rel="nofollow">Leak Monitor</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/footprint/leak-gauge.pl?raw=1" rel="nofollow">Leak Gauge</a></li>
</ul>

I just found these two articles while searching for the above articles and should probably try using them:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/scriptable/avoiding-leaks.html" rel="nofollow">Avoiding Leaks when using XPCOM</a> (didn't know I had to pay attention to this)</li> 
  <li><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance:Leak_Tools" rel="nofollow">How to Debug Leaks</a></li>
</ul>

You may have noticed most of these tools are aimed at a lower level than I'm working at.  I'd like more tools that worked at the JavaScript level.

It seems <a href="http://dbaron.org/" rel="nofollow">David Baron</a> is the guru of memory leaks.  If I don't have more luck, maybe I'll for help.

Ciao!

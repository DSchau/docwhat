I can't seem to get this working with the following script:

[code lang="shell"]
#!/bin/sh
urxvt -e zsh -c &quot;vim $@&quot;
[/code]

All that happens is vim tries to edit a "visible-stats" buffer and an "on" buffer.  What do you pass as parameters to the program?  It seems to me you are sending "visible-stats on" at some point, which is bizarre.  Any ideas?

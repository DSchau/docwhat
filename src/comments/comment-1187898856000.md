Hi,

I am using IAT on my G4 Imac. 

Os x 10.4.10

Firefox 2.0.0.6

Greasemonkey is disabled.

I installed the iat.sh shell script, and when I type

open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app $*

Textwrangler opens right up.  However, clicking on the IAT edit button does not invoke the editor.  Nor does ctrl-click and selecting IAT from the contextual menu.

IAT is configured to point directly at the script:

/Users/englishdepartment/iat.sh

Any suggestions?  Thank you for creating something cool for the world to use.

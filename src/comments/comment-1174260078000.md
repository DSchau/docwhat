This is a neat idea. However, edit icon is often not rendered at all for textareas (e.g. gmail compose new mail, slashdot.org comment etc). Sometimes the edit image is rendered "off screen" (for example  blogspot comment text area) etc.

Extension is also supposed to work with entire web pages? In my case context menu is available only on about:blank, and as soon as I load any other page, context menu is not there?

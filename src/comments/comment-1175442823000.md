  Re: too many \\ characters --
     It's not a bug in It's All Text!  It's just the way wordpress deals with '\'.  If it's in quotes, it won't do the escaping.  I don't fully understand the rules myself, but there they are.

  Re: .xhtml vs .txt --
    The comment box here sets the extension to .xhtml instead of .txt

  Re: Not being able to change the editor --
     It looks like you found a bug in IAT.  You can fix this temporarily by changing your 'extensions.itsalltext.editor' in your <code>prefs.js</code>.

  Re: The error message. --
     I think that the error message isn't actually useful. :-/  Firefox is unable to actually report the real reason, as near as I can tell.

Ciao!

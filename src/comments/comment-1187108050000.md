spoko:

Thanks!  Regarding the special characters being munged, this is because your editor and IAT don't agree on the character set.  By default, IAT uses UTF-8.  If your editor doesn't handle that or if your editor assumes it's some other charset, then you will get the behavior you described.

Try changing the charset to match what your editor thinks it is.  Possibly iso-8859-15 or some windows proprietary charset (I don't use windows).

Ciao!

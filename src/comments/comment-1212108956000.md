Hi, I find this extension really useful.
Is there a way to detect when a save has occurred?  I have a page where i'd like to update a preview whenever the external editor does a save.

I figure i could add an onchange= event on the textarea that checks for the yellow glow to figure out if the change came from IAT.  has anyone done this already?

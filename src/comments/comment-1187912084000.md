Mark Crane:

One last check.... Hum... actually, now that I think about it, nano can never work because it runs in a terminal, unless the Mac OS X opens a terminal for you.  You would have to have the iat.sh script open a terminal and then run nano.  That's beyond my Mac OS X knowledge.

I don't know the other editor you mention, does it also open in a terminal?

Ciao!

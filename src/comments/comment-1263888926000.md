A feature suggestion:

Allow setting default extension based on the server domain.

I could then set tiddlyspot.com to use .tw and wikipedia.org to use .mediawiki - allowing me to detect filetype and automatically use the correct syntax highlighting in vim - whilst leaving other domains to use .txt

I'm sure this feature would also be useful for bloggers, who might want some slightly different behaviour for blog entry than for other editing tasks.

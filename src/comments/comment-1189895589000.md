Hi, this is an excellent plugin! Keep up the good work!

I'm a heavy vim user and also use the vimperator plugin to surf the web, thus the only thing I need to use the mouse for is to start that editor ;-)
So as many before me I once again say: Pretty please with sugar on top, add a hotkey, any hotkey, no need for it to be configurable, just add it soon. :-)

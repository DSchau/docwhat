I'm running Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn), Firefox 2.0.0.4, IAT 0.7.2.  I've reproduced the problem without any other desktop applications running, so I don't think something is stealing the focus.  Also, the window decoration doesn't change color as if the focus was grabbed by another application.  It looks much more like the focus leaves the textarea but stays with Firefox.  It doesn't happen all the time, and I'll try to narrow down the cause.  If I can figure out the circumstances under which it can be reproduced, I'll let you know.  Thanks, Ted

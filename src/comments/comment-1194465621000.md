I love this extension!  However it doesn't work for me with the new version of Gmail.  (Currently, for me at least, Gmail has two versions available, and I have to click on "Older version" or "Newer version" in the upper-right-hand corner to switch between them.)  It worked fine with the older version of Gmail, but now it doesn't seem to recognize the textareas correctly.  The floating edit button never appears. *Sometimes* the context menu contains the "It's all text" menu, but if I try to edit it that way the changes I make in my editor never seem to get noticed by the textarea.  I assume Gmail has some new javascript nonsense that's confusing it... any idea what's wrong?

I'm on Mac OSX and have had the same issues described above.  I use BBEdit, and in /usr/bin/ there IS an executable for BBEdit.

If you choose that, the dialog box will not go away, and you have to quit FF.  When you relaunch, however, the system seems to work, bringing up BBedit when you click the Edit button.

Would be nice to fix this, or at least make a note to that effect on the plugin page where you download the thing so other OSX users won't waste their time.  Also, the default editor is something I've never heard of - would be nice to choose something most Mac users are likely to have.

As requested, I am putting my comments in here, as well :)

1) IAT should try to execute the editor within a shell, not call a binary directly. As it is, it is impossible to pass parameters to the executable. A shellscript is a working but kludgy work-around.

2) The position of the edit button should be changeable.

Thanks a lot for your script! :)

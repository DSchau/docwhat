Blixtor:

Thanks for the information.  To be honest, I don't own any copies of Windows at home so I don't test it under windows.  I made the (obviously incorrect) assumption that <code><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/nsIFilePicker" rel="nofollow">nsIFilePicker</a>.filterApps</code> would show <tt>.cmd</tt> and <tt>.com</tt> files.

Is there no box to change what you're looking at?  i.e. a drop down that says <tt>*.exe</tt> or something that you can choose <tt>*.*</tt> from?

Ciao!

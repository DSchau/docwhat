Ran accross this and your onclick trick solves a couple of my problems, in a different way.
It allows me to open the link using the default behavior (a new tab, if set up that way) as opposed to opening with window.open(), which always gives a new window. For some reason...
At the same time I can run additional javascript that needs to be done when the link is clicked, and I have the option of continuing on to open the link or not.

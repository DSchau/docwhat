Hi,

I'm another Mac user having trouble getting this going.

Latest version of Leopard
Latest Firefox
Latest It's all text

Trying to get IAT to use Aquamacs

IAT works fine when I let it default to textedit.

Created the following script to connect to Aquamacs

#!/bin/sh 
# This is an example shell script for It's All Text!

if [ ! -f "$@" ]; then
touch "$@"
fi

open -a /Applications/Aquamacs/"Aquamacs Emacs.app" "$@"

The script starts Aquamacs when I run it from the shell in the terminal.

When I put:

/usr/bin/open -a ~/iat.sh

into the editor in IAT's preferences. I get "The path does not exist".

I'm sure there is something simple I'm doing wrong but if someone could offer some 
help I'd appreciate it.

Thanks for any help.

John

P.S. The tool works swell with textedit; I'd like to be able to use the emacs wikipedia mode though.

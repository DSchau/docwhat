PZ: Not currently.  I know that Mozex added that feature in the last year or so.

You'd have to click on the textarea or select it via keyboard before you used the key-combination to fire up your editor.  Since you can pick the extension, I'm not entirely sure how this'd work.  

I'll add it as a future item.  Right now, getting the kinks out of the basic system comes first.

Ciao!

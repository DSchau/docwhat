If you can make this work in Chrome on Linux, that would be truly awesome.  I can't tell you how often I am working in Chrome and then have to launch Firefox just to use your handy extension.  As a developer, being able to write ticket descriptions and comments in my editor of choice rather than a text area is solid gold.

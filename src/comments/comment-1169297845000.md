[FF 2.0.0.1, Mac OSX 10.4.8]

No matter what text editor I select (e.g., TextEdit, TextWrangler, BBEdit), I get the pref box that says it can't run it.

Trying another is a pain because the pref box does not dismiss. I have to quit and relaunch FF.

You may also want to correct the language in the pref box:

"You the browse button..."

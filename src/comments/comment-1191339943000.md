I commented in earlier version about edit button appearing in nearly the same place as TWiki buttons.  Checked and is the same in 0.8.

You replied about making the edit button disappear, but I must have explained badly because this is backwards.  It's the EDIT button which dappears *under* the buttons which TWiki is putting there, which was why I suggested being able to move the EDIT button.

If the EDIT button were on top, then your solution would suit me fine, too.  Though the EDIT button does seem to disppear already when focus isn't in the textarea.

I can just see the top of the EDIT button so it's not a showstopper, and it's still a great add-on!

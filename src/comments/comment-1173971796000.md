era:  I'm glad you like it!  It does indeed leave temporary files around.  However, they should be cleaned up by one of two processes:
<ul>
  <li>On exit, they should be deleted by Firefox (assuming it doesn't crash or something).</li>
  <li>If the file hangs around more than a certain time (I think a week), then It's All Text! will delete it on it's own, assuming your clock isn't jumping around like crazy.</li>
</ul>

Thanks for checking on that though. :-D

Ciao!

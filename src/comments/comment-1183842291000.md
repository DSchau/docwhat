Kendra,

I was reading your response to Sammy up above, and started researching your site, also. You know what really bothers me other than your systems requiring consumers to send in postcards, what appears to be your blogging efforts to "defame" other companies according to others, and your company's president historicals, also according to others... The funny coincidence that some of the text used on your GreenDimes.com web site is really similar to that used on USJunkmail.com, keeping in mind that USJunkmail.com was founded and launched prior to GreenDimes.com. I will continue my research and be certain to post along the way. Here is just a typical example, that was really easy to find because not too many companies really use the word "curb". Oh, and I fully copied your site in its current state, so the prior original will be fully documentable in the event of subsequent changes. I am also notifying USJunkmail.com to conduct their own research.

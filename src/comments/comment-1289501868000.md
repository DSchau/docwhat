The suggested .cmd file isn't working because the argument isn't being passed in.  I'm not much at Windows CMD, but I think it needs to have <code>%1</code> added after the command to pass the name of the file to the java command.

As for the rest, I honestly don't know. I don't use jedit or even Java.  So I'm not sure how to tell it to open an existing instance instead of a new one. The web page at http://www.jedit.org/users-guide/cli-usage.html implies there is a jedit command line tool that will do this for you, somehow.

I'll talk to you off-line about the comment threading.

Yikes!  Okay, I need to take another look at that. I don't think that it would *replace* an existing tab.  But I could see it adding too many.

I'll have to fix this before 1.0 as well.

Thanks for reporting that it could get that bad.  I knew it could create two instead of one, but I didn't think it could make tens or more.  I'm guessing if the computer is busy or slow when it starts, it could create tons. :-(

Ciao!

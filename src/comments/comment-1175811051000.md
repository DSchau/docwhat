Hi DocWhat,
Nice extension, but...

I had been using version o.6.1 in OSX with a .app editor, just by pointing IAT! towards the appropriate binary inside the .app package ("/Applications/WriteRoom.app/Contents/MacOS/WriteRoom")

Unfortunately this doesn't work with 0.6.3, (and neither,of course, does referencing the .app) - is there another work-around?

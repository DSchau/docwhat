Oleg,

Yeah.  The unload event fires at weird times.  It also (along with load) fires more times than one would expect because there are a bunch of 'micro' documents created and destroyed (as near as I can tell).

One of the things that maybe causing problems is my XPCOM usage.  I wish that the documentation on <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/" rel="nofollow">developer.mozilla.org</a> included patterns for safe usage of them elements. :-/

Ciao!

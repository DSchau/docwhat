Verizon DSL - RUN LIKE THE WIND DON'T LOOK BACK. DO NOT INSTALL VERIZON DSL. It is not high speed internet.  My service  was less than dial up.  Service installed August 6, 2008.  Service canceled August 11, 2008.

Start up error messages. Poor upload  and download speeds. Can't open web pages.  Poor tech support - and they speak very bad english and tell you lies.  

I will never forgive Verizon.  They made my PC so unstable with all their so called screen sharing  tech assistance, that my computer crashed and died. My less than 2 years old computer that never had any problems until installed with verizon modem Westall 6100 that is not going to work, and all the rest of the mess that is installed on your PC by Verizon.

VERIZON YOU KILLED MY COMPUTER AND I HATE YOU.  CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW! ! !

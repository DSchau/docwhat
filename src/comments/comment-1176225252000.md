Philip King:

Thanks for the feedback.

I'm not familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_NaturallySpeaking" rel="nofollow">NaturallySpeaking</a> or DragonPad.  It seems that DragonPad is a notepad replacement.  If you use that as your editor, when you save then "It's All Text!" should automagically detect the change and refresh the text box for you.  Make sure you edit the file as txt, not as formatted text or anything like that.  Preferrably as UTF-8.

Ciao!

A reply that is a couple of years late, but to clarify:

The expression <code>//node = 'red fish'</code> will compare the computed string value of each of the selected node elements, and if any of the items in the set equal "red fish", it will return <code>true()</code>.

If you wanted to select the node element's who's computed string value is "red fish", you could use the following:
<code>//node[. = 'red fish']</code>, which uses a predicate filter to select only the <code>node</code> element's who's computed string value equals "red fish".

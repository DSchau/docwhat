@Andre Angelantoni:

Okay, it looks like <code>open</code> doesn't like the file not existing.  You may have to change your script to:
[code lang="shell"]
#!/bin/sh

if [ ! -f &quot;$1&quot; ]; then
  touch &quot;$1&quot;
fi

exec open -a /Application/TextMate.app &quot;$1&quot;
[/code]

The big change being the if statements that check if the file exists.  If it doesn't then it touches it.

You should be able to run the script for the command line and it should work if you give it a filename that doesn't exist, like /tmp/foobarbaz.txt

I hope I am posting this in the right place.  Back in the <a href="http://docwhat.org/2007/01/its-all-text/comment-page-1/#comments" rel="nofollow">original 2007 thread</a> someone brought up the problem of jEdit, which, being a Java program, doesn't have an exe to which IAT can be pointed.  The proposed solution was to create a .cmd file with syntax something like this:

"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "C:\Program Files\jEdit\jedit.jar"

And point IAT to that cmd file instead of the jEdit program itself.  The original poster of this question reported that the solution worked; for me, however, there are two problems:

1. It opens the jEdit text editor but <i>doesn't load my text</i>!
2. It opens a new instance of jEdit instead of a new buffer in my already-running instance.

Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I don't know if you're aware of this issue, but the font display of comment threads here is completely messed up in Firefox 3.6 on Windows 7.  The font looks so bad I can just barely read it and had to zoom in just to type this.  Thought you might want to know :-)

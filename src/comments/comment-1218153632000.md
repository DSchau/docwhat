@Brian of London

No, you aren't dim.  There is a bug in IAT under FF3. cipher_nemo refered to it above.

Basically, set the value via the about:config display. :-(

I'm sorry, I've been busy with a lot of other things and I haven't used it as much in work so I haven't bee working on IAT much at all.

Ciao!

Hi Christian,

0.6.0 is working well on my Mac too.  I like the context menu.

I notice that I still can't edit the main textarea in the GMail compose screen,
the button doesn't appear and the context menu is all gray except for the
Preferences item.  So it seems to me that It's All Text! is not recognizing the
main textarea as a text area.  I guess Google might be doing something funny.  

I also notice that if I bring up the preferences dialog from the context menu,
there are no buttons that I can use to dismiss it (no OK or Cancel buttons).  I
have to hit Escape to get out.  This is probably an OSX thing as the preferences
dialog is displayed as a drop down sheet attached to the current window, rather
than in a separate window.  See http://flickr.com/photos/vanessahugh/434243324/

If I launch the preferences dialog by clicking on the Preferences button in the
Add-ons manager, then I get a normal dialog with a close button.  See

If there is anything I can do to help with these bugs, please tell me.

Thanks again.

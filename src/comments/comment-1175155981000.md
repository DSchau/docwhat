Hi,

I'm using your plugin for all my Wiki submissions and it's really cool.

I wish it would be possible to have an option in your plugin preferences to make the browser textarea not editable, since the editable textarea invites the user to change the text there even when he or she is already editing it in an external editor. So things can get messy if one accidentally modifies the text both in the browser and in the external editor.

I think an option to make the browser textareas read-only would remedy the problem.

Anyway, thanks for contributing such nice plugin.

Dusan

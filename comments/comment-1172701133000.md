@Shufla: I'm trying to collect test cases where the button doesn't appear correctly.  I currently have trac, wordpress, and wikipedia (I think).

@Brad: I've added your bug and idea to my todo list. :-)  Thanks for the feedback.

@Terry Lee: The "You the browse button" typo was fixed in newer versions (0.4+).  I can't figure out what is going on from your description, I'll email you and if there is any generally useful info, I'll post it back here.

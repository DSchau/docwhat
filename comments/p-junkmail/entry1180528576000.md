Hi Kendra!

Obviously you pay attention to people who invoke your name. :-)

Do you provide a list of the steps that you have made to remove people from
the mailing lists? Or any other sort of information that can be checked up on?

I'm not accusing you or any of the other anti-junk-mail companies of anything,
but if I wanted to make a quick buck while being a slime; I could create a
company and collect the money, add the person to the DMA list and then call it
quits. If the someone complains, I would just say, "You can't expect every bit
of junk mail to be stopped."

Actually, just a couple of screen shots or a video of someone using the
interface to show how you are giving the customer feedback.

Ciao!

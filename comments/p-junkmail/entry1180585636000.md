Thanks Christian for posting my comments, accidents happen!

We really appreciate your directness and honesty in your post yesterday. 

To address your "plant a tree" question.... stopping junk mail = saving forests, but we wanted to do a little more.

We have been planting a tree for each new subscriber with American Forests Global ReLeaf projects, www.americanforests.org/global_releaf/projects, for a number of reasons. 

Replanting means that our kids and future generations will have a place to enjoy the outdoors, can you imagine what it would be like if we had no place to mountain bike, ski, camp or hike? Planting trees can help reduce green house gases, help prevent soil errosion and regenerate habitats for our animals and birds. We try to do just a little bit to help and enpower others to get out there and do the same.

Thanks again.
Margot

Hi there- thanks for this post about stopping junk mail! I am writing from
GreenDimes to tell you that we are, in fact, a legitimate business that has
already stopped 587,000 pounds of junk mail, planted more than 183,000 trees
on our members behalf and saved some 1,500,000 gallons of water. We are able
to save valuable resources by taking action for each of our members, and here
is how: first, we get your name off of various direct mailing company's lists.
Second, we give each of our members the tools to manage the catalogs they
recieve; Once you sign up, you are able to go into your account through our
website and let us know which catalogs you wish to no longer recieve (and keep
the ones you want!) We have researched some 3,000 catalogs and are able to opt
our members out of such mailings. Third, for every month that you are a member
with GreenDimes, we will plant a tree (with one of our three tree-planting
partners, who you can read more about on our website) on your behalf. So in
addition to reducing your junk mail, we are also replenishing the resources
already used. GreenDimes is actionable, accountable and the work we do is
measurable. Check us out if you haven't already! www.greendimes.com. Take good
care and please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.
Thanks again for your post. -Kendra www.greendimes.com

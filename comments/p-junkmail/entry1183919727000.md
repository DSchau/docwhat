Kendra,

That "coincidence" in paragraph bothered me so much that I recopied my
complaint above onto www.ripoffreport.com. I see I am also NOT the 1st
complaint on ripoffreport.com. You should take a look at the other ones. My
only regret is that I referred to the company I am a sales rep with,
USJunkmail.com. I can only assume the assaults will happen on them, shortly,
even though to my readings they have ( 0 ) complaints so far, and that is
after 1 1/2 years of operation. Pretty impressive. They also have thousands of
happy sales reps, so I am sure their shoulders are broad enough for what may
be coming. USJ is a terrific company with an outstanding record. And they also
just made a statement recently that most likely will completely restructure
the postal stop junk mail industry for free! But as always they will be taking
care of us reps with some additional products, etc..

Thanks for the suggestions.  I don't have access to the twiki source, but I'll see if I can capture and sanitize a couple pages to create a test case.  I have disabled all plugin's except IAT and the problem still occurs (all FF v2.x versions and both Windows and Linux).  When I disable IAT, the problem goes away, so it seems definitely related.

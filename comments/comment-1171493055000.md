Can you add, at the same time, a mutex? If there's already a running editor on a textarea, and the edit button is hit, could it confirm the desired action?

Also, what is the interaction with itsjusttext and something like the moinmoin preview button?

Let me describe what just happened to me, which is I was foolish about both of the above things

1) Edited document (moinmoin wiki page)
2) After many hours of editing, left the editor open, came back (lots of fact finding).
3) Saved multiple times, but accidentally opened a new editor.
4) Closed the new editor, felt an idiot, kept going. Documents saved in editor1 still caused updates.
5) Saved the document, closed up, and hit "preview"
6) Moin had timed out my session and told me to click the editor again or something silly. 1 day of work down the drain (fortunately only about an hour of editing to recover it, but how do I avoid it?)

Thanks,

-Peter

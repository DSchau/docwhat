I agree that 99% of users would just stomp on "Yes." I would also understand a
web browser having a "Yes to all in the future" check box. The prompts would
be to get that last remaining 1% that would ask "What is SuperFish?" and blog
about it. Rather than silently trusting all CAs for all users, at least
encourage some users to be part of the auditing process.

I would also prefer a common API, CLI and certificate file format. Instead, I
feel IPSEC adoption was crippled by the complexity of enrolling certificates.
Not only was there the issue that some systems wanted pk12 files and others
wanted pem, but the steps taken to enrolled would change even between versions
of the same OS.

But did keychain enrollment at least help?

Also: "Hi, Christian!"

era: Thanks.

Geez. I always get those mixed up when I'm just typing. I'm glad I could help.
Rockbox is even cooler than when I wrote this. Though I wish they had the
[Scroll Wheel Acceleration](http://www.rockbox.org/tracker/task/5594) patch
for the iPods. I have something like 3000 artists, so scrolling through the
list takes a little while...

Mark Crane:

Huh... odd.  Is there a dialog popping up saying that it couldn't run the editor?

If not, can you look for any error messages in the JavaScript Error Console (or Firebug if you have that installed)?

You may have to set <tt>javascript.options.strict</tt> to true in <tt>about:config</tt> to get more messages.

Ciao!

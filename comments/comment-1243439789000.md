I've been using IAT at work religiously for at least 2 years now. I've got a problem with firefox 3, and the 3.1/3.5 betas on windows. It seems that when IAT is enabled, my browser experiences a lot of latency - 1-2 seconds to focus on click, the same to get focus for text entry, to respond to entering info into text entry boxes (even after the text entry box has focus and as I'm typing), etc. At the same time, other windows apps (editors, outlook, VNC session, etc.) are steady and don't experience the delay. This happens whether or not I'm editing anything with IAT, but it goes away when IAT is disabled in the add-ons menu and firefox is re-started.

Please let me know if there's anything I can provide to further troubleshoot this.

Currently I'm using FF 3.5b4, and IAT 1.3.1.

Thanks,

-Peter

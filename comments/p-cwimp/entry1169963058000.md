Just a FYI, this game still works. I play 2.7beta on my Treo650
(PalmOSv5.4.8). I've never had a crash that I can attribute to this game.
Granted, it doesn't have 256colors, music, or fold my laundry but this game
doesn't need all that. Thanx for a great version of this dice game that I used
to play a lot in High School study hall.

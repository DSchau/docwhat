This is good news.  I bought Spore before reading anything, raging with excitement.  Now I am contemplating never downloading, installing, or activating, and attempting to return it.

That said, I was hoping that my magic mac-armor would protect me from the worst of any drm, or at least that it would be easier to manually root out after the fact.  So now I am going to give in to my base instincts for self-gratification and play the game anyhoo...

Yours is basically the extent of the info I have been able to find without delving into shadowy site and list land.

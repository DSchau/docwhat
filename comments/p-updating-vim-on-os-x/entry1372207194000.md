Ah, sorry, I was referring to the <kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd> /
<kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>right</kbd> key bindings which makes moving between
words significantly easier. However, if you're on OS X, usually you can use
<kbd>option</kbd> in place of <kbd>control</kbd> but apparently not in the OS
X version of Vim.

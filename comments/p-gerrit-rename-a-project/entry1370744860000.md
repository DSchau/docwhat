As of Gerrit 2.5.3, there is no longer a projects table nor a ref_rights
table, so you just have to update the remaining two: account_project_watches
and changes. You'll also want to rename the git repository on disk, of course.
There is documentation on the process at
<http://ci.openstack.org/gerrit.html#renaming-a-project>, though parts of it
are specific to the openstack gerrit installation.

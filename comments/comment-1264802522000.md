I don't think the .xpi is being cached by FF is the issue. I tried it again after restarting FF and then again after a full computer reboot but got exactly the same error message about it not being compatible with Firefox 3.5.7 each time.

On the description for v1.4, you wrote "It only works in FF3.6", is there perhaps someplace you've hardcoded it so it won't work in any lessor version of FF?

Thomas, I'm not sure why you want to have a batch file that runs
a shell that invokes a shell script that calls your editor, but I
guess you have your reasons.

If you don't require this complication, just configure
It's All Text to use "gvim".

The problem with having so many things calling each other is that
command line parsing gets very complicated.
"C:Documents" is the first argument in the command line when
asking to edit
"C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\blah\itsalltext\blah.txt"

If you change the "%1" to %* (no quotes) in your text.bat,
I think it will work for you.

Good luck!

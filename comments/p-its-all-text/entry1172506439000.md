Having multiple instances open of the same program is not a good thing. On slower computers it takes too long to start the application all the time. And each instance use memory. There is a nice UNIX command available on MacOSX which takes care of starting a program only once: "open". So theoretically, we could have a small shell script like the one below which takes care of the preferred editor as well as only having the editor open once. The only problem is that I don't know how to pass the file "~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/default.ju5/itsalltext/1j1i23382p2r1w2.txt" to the "open" command as e.g. parameter $FILE.

[code lang="shell"]
#!/bin/sh
EDITOR=&quot;/Applications/Text/Smultron.app&quot;
open -a $EDITOR $FILE
[/code]

Any hints about passing parameters to an externals shell script?

Regards, Marc

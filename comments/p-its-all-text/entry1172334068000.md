Hi!

Nice extension!

Couple of things:

 * It does not seem work with Flock (http://flock.com).

 * I can't get jEdit to work with it. To run it, you need to run something like this:

    C:\j2sdk1.4.2_09\bin\javaw.exe -jar "C:\Program Files\jEdit\jedit.jar"

And you can't select this from a file chooser...

Thanks,

Martin Polley

@prasun It sure does! That was definitely one of the requirements. As someone
who has an umlaut in his last name, I insist on Unicode wherever I travel.

Now, it may not work on pages that don't set their charsets correctly. This is
because IAT converts from the page charset to UTF-8 for editing (see the
preferences) and then back again. So if the page is in (for example) telugu,
but has a charset of ascii, then the IAT cannot figure that out that the page
is lying.

Do you have a specific failure case? I'm happy to take a look.

Ciao!

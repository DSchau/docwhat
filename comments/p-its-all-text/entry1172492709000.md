I repost here what the same thing that I submitted on the mozilla home page:

MacOSX: Works with all editors...it's just a little bit tricky. First, in the
Finder, click with right mouse button on Application icon, choose "Show
Package Contents", then navigate through Contents to MacOS. Second, in the
preference of this add-on, click on the browse button and then drag&amp;drop
the executable within the folder MacOS from before into this "Choose your
Editor" window. Third, in the drop-down menu of the "Choose your Editor" go up
one level to "Contents" and then navigate to the executable in the "MacOS"
folder. Finally, you have chosen your editor! This might look like
"/Applications/Smultron.app/Contents/MacOS/Smultron". If the developer would
just make the "Editor" field manually editable we could just add the paths
ourself or copy&amp;paste paths from the Terminal.app.

And there is the problem of opening multiple instances of the same program. I
wonder if we should have an interim shell or applescript that checks if the
preferred editor is already running or not...

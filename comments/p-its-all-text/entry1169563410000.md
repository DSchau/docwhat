Hello Christian! Nice name. :-)

The plugin does indeed save the output as UTF-8 (as in the preferences).
However, I don't write a Byte-Order Mark to the beginning of the file. I don't
do that because a lot of editors don't know what to do with it.

Try asking Boxer to read the file as UTF-8 instead of the Windows Default
UTF-16 (little endian).

The fact that Notepad can read it implies that it is written correctly. If
that doesn't work, then zip up and email one of the files that Boxer cannot
read correctly to me. I'll double check that it is being written correctly.

My last name (HÃ¶ltje) has an umlaut in it and I use it with It's All Text! all
the time.

Ciao!

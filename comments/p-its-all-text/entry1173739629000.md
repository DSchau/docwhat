Very nice extension!
Couple of observations:
1. The fact that the extension can be selected is somewhat "hidden". It took me a while to discover that I could force a .php extension (*) to the file (to enable syntax highlighting in Gedit). If it could be made a bit more obvious, that would be great.
2. Would be nice to allow parameters to the editor command-line. E.g., to allow running mcedit in gnome-terminal or something like that.

(*) - Oh, and I had to add .php to the list. ;-)

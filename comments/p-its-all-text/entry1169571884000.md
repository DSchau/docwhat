Thanks Christian,

I found the problem: my editor (Boxer) does not support Unicode. But I like
Boxer so much, that I have to live with it. MozEx has an option to not use
UTF-8. Disabling UTF-8 works fine for Boxer (â‚¬ does not work, but Umlaute are
fine). With UTF-8 enabled the behaviour is identical to "It's all text" Could
you provide ANSI-encoding?

Best regards Christian

Shift, alt or something similar clicking on the edit button would copy the
path to the file for the text area. The idea being you could copy this path,
then type something like:

```sh
cp /etc/hosts [paste]
```

And that'd update the textarea quickly. How cool is that?

Similar in concept to jeroenvrp's idea: It would be great if you could choose
an alternative editor, with clicking shift, alt or ctrl when clicking the blue
edit button.

But I think more generically useful.

Ciao!

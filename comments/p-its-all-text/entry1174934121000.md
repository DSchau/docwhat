ItsAllText (IAT) is one of my favorite plug-ins, and I've got
plenty. Too many, honestly.

But it has one behavior that I don't quite understand. I can live
with it, but it makes me think that something's slightly amiss with
the interaction of IAT and Firebug...

I use the fabulous Firebug web development extension
(http://getfirebug.org/) every day. It has a fine feature that makes
it easy to inspect a specific element on a page: control-click the
element of interest and select "Inspect Element" from the context
menu, and it opens Firebug with that element selected in the HTML
pane on the left, and its styles showing in the CSS pane on the
right. Beauty.

With IAT installed, however, that selected element has two new
properties added to it:

    id="itsalltext_generated_id__1"

and

    itsalltext_uid="1i22272h2135352u2p1k2w1z2x1b1w2d3b1k261i1y3b1p1p"

These are present no matter what element I select on the page. I
guess it's part of IAT's inner workings, but it is somewhat
distracting.

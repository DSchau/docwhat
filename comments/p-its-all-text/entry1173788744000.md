Florin Andrei:

Thank you for the complement and for taking the time to give me feedback. :-)

Regarding the extension changing being hidden. I agree. I originally wanted a
right-click on the gumdrop to popup that menu. At the moment, there is a menu,
but it is control-click not right-click. This is due to the way the context
menu works in browser context in Firefox. I don't seem to be able to override
it. Other developers confirmed it, unfortunately. I have another idea, but I'm
not sure it's a good one....

Regarding parameters: It would be nice, but because it works across multiple
platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOSX) and because firefox doesn't have execl\*()
type functions, only the exec() like
<a href="http://xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIProcess.html" rel="nofollow">nsIProcess</a>,
I would have to write my own parameter parser and quoter for every platform.
This is a very trick and hard to do in a cross-platform way. I may yet do it,
but it will be a late addition.

Meanwhile, you can create a shell script (sh, bash, cmd, bat or whatever your
platform handles well) to do what you want. In your example, you could do
something like:

[code lang="shell"]#!/bin/sh gnome-terminal -x someeditor &quot;\$@&quot;
[/code]

Thanks again!

Ciao!

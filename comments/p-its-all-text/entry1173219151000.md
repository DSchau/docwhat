@John: Thanks for the feedback! The next version will have a preference to
turn off the "edit" button. Unfortunately,
<a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/" rel="nofollow">addons</a> has been busy
with their
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2007/03/05/review-queue-completed/" rel="nofollow">upgrade</a>
and aren't scheduled to be done till the 15th.

Ciao!

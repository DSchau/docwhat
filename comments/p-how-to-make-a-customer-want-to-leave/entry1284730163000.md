Speakeasy is the best home/business ISP I've dealt with. They eventually
<a href="http://docwhat.org/2009/03/how-speakeasy-made-it-better" rel="nofollow">made
it better</a>.

I've looked at hosting, but I'd rather spend the extra \$50/mo. on something
else. I don't actually make any money off my site, so I do it on the cheap

Ciao!

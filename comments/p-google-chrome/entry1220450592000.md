Chrome is far from perfect for sure; It renders fast thanks to webkit, the
JavaScript engine is the fastest I've seen, and it takes up much less memory
than FF3. It's not a bad beta, and it could replace my SSB of choice if/when
they work out the bugs. For example, it doesn't quite work right with
Bloglines (beta).

I like using it for some things, like Gmail and the other Google apps it was
specifically designed to work with, but until it can match the addon goodness
of Firefox, it definitely won't be replacing it any time soon.

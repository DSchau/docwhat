I think this is a wonderful extension. One minor issue I have is that the right-mouse action is occluded by the behavior of the "easyGestures" plug in.  If there were some alternative way of bringing up that choice menu, that'd be nice. (Shift-click?)

Still - really, really nice and extremely welcome. Thank you for doing such a service for the community.

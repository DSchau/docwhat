I like your article on Xen Networking, thanks!

Assuming i duplicate and rename the original file "network-bridge", to
"my-network-bridge" is the following code all thats required for that file, or
is it inserted into the code somewhere?

```bash
#!/bin/bash
dir=$(dirname "$0")
"$dir/network-bridge" "$@" vifnum=0 netdev=eth0   bridge=lan
"$dir/network-bridge" "$@" vifnum=1 netdev=eth1   bridge=wan
"$dir/network-bridge" "$@" vifnum=2 netdev=dummy0 bridge=dmz
# EOF
```

Many thanks in advance

Well, that and I need a Linux and Mac OS versions... ;-)

I noticed that all the various animation things (like <a href="http://ui.jquery.com/repository/real-world/effects/" rel="nofollow">ui.jQuery's demo</a>) caused bouncing around like it doesn't calculate the offset correctly.

I assumed things like that will be fixed.  They did mention they weren't really ready for an announcement.

Ciao!

Hiya John!

Thanks for the pointer to egullet. I didn't find that when I was
looking for information.

Shame on you for being mean, though.

You are right about the baking soda. I thought I had removed that
when I rewrote the article.

The history of the article:

-   I got the original recipe from a friend who had hand copied it
    from a county cook book. The recipe worked and produced decent
    bread.
-   I put it on my web site.
-   The recipe somehow made it up to the first page of results on
    Google. I don't know what happened, it must have been linked to.
-   I updated my site and the recipe was removed.
-   I still got hits for the (now missing) page.
-   After about a year and a half of that, I updated my site again.
-   Since the original recipe, I have made beer and spent a bit more
    time with yeasty-beasties. So I updated the recipe, though out
    some bogus parts, rewrote it in my own style and re-posted it.

I have never heard that flour has yeasts in it. It makes sense.
Yeasts are everywhere. Our old house has nasty things that taste
awful. However, I would think that the processes that flour goes
though would kill the yeasts.

I haven't been able to experiment much, since my current house isn't
very temperature controlled and has a teeny tiny kitchen.

Ciao!

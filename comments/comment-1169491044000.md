It's a very usefull extension for Wikipedia, so you can easy edit articles in an external editor. A textarea on Wikipedia however has the full width of the screen, so the edit button felt for the half outside the screen and caused a horizontal scrollbar.

I have changed the margin of the button in itsalltext.js, so the right margin of the button is equal to the right margin of the textarea and the button doesn't cover partly the textarea.
It is row 639, I have changed it to:
    gumdrop.style.margin           = ['0 -',width,'px'].join('');

Maybe you can make this optional.

Hans.

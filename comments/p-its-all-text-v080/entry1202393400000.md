Actually easyGestures (like other such extensions) steals the contextmenu event; basically the gestures take over from what the context menu does. I'm not very familiar with the runtime model in the XUL domain.

As I said, this is not a major issue for me now. (Did I dream it or did I really read somewhere that I can set the file extension with an attribute on the textarea tag?)

Thanks again!

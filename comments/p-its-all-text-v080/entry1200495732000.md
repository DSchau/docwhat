Georg:

Hi! My middle name is Georg, also. ^\_^

You have two issues:

<ul>
  <li>You need to either save as UTF-8 or change the charset (see the <a href="http://docwhat.org/2007/10/its-all-text-v080/#comment-3923" rel="nofollow">reply</a> to Rafael.)</li>
  <li>Hyperlinks won't work because they get lost when you save as text.  That'd be a StarOffice issue</li>
</ul>

Ciao!

I was looking forward to trying "It's All Text" today, but after installing
the latest release (0.82) under Firefox 1.5.0.12 on CentOS Linux 5, it just
doesn't work for me. No button appears on the text boxes. Right clicking text
fields shows the pop-up menu, but choosing "It's All Text" options (including
Preferences) results in nothing at all. I tried closing and reopening Firefox,
uninstalling and reinstalling "It's All Text", but nada. If I choose Tools
&gt; Extensions, select "It's All Text" from the list, and click the
Preferences button in the dialog box, then at least I get a Preferences dialog
box for "It's All Text". But that's it.

Can you help me out? I'd really love to use vim to edit text in these large
textareas.

Many thanks.

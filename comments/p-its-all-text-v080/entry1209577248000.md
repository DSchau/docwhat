@Trevor:

Yeah, I've had the problem where all the random-hashes are the same because
POST variables are used for editing everything.

The problem with using POST variables to build the hash is that most pages use
POST variables to pass in the data.

I'm not sure what the solution is except to allow users to write some sort of
solution for their websites themselves. But it seems hacky and I really don't
want to add so much interface stuff.

I'll keep thinking about it. If you come up with a solution, please tell. :-)

Ciao!

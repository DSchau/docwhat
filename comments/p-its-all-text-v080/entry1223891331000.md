@tacitdynamite - thanks for offering a suggestion, even if it isn't your area of expertise (it's not mine, either, obviously!).

I've tried a couple of scripts which were posted as possibly addressing the issue.  For example, I'm now trying the script (it's sh, not bash) which was posted under the name iat.sh at http://docwhat.org/2007/03/its_all_text_v06/.  This version doesn't have both an open and an exec.  I think I've tried about three different scripts which have been posted.

When I run it from the command line, it gives the following error:
2008-10-13 12:40:11.304 open[2319] LSOpenFromURLSpec() returned -10827 for application /usr/bin/vi path /Users/ann/info/l.
2008-10-13 12:40:11.304 open[2319] Couldn't open file: /Users/ann/info/l
I touched the file, so it exists, but I still get the error.

When I try it from FF, nothing happens at all.

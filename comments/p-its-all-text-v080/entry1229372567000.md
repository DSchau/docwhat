I’m using Arch Linux and Vim for editing with your extension. It works all
great, just good work! But is there possibility to style the button via CSS or
something – or will there be such possibility? Would be really cool, to style
the button to my needs (and moving it via negative maring values inside the
text area _g_)

Kind regards, Dirk

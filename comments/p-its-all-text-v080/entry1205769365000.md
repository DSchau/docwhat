I've used this extension before, but I started a new profile a few weeks ago and just rediscovered this add-on again today.

I liked it before, but unfortunately I can't seem to get this extension working in Firefox 3.0b4.  No edit button, hotkey doesn't work, etc.  I know it's entirely possible there may be something wrong on my setup.  I can help troubleshoot if you're interested, otherwise I'll try again after the next update...

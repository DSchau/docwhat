Hi Sam!

The first thing I'd try is moving the edit button to a different corner. This
fixes certain sites, depending on how they were written. I suspect they are
using YUI and it's probably getting upset that the autocomplete container is
being moved.

Otherwise, feel free to open a bug at http://trac.gerf.org/itsalltext about
it. Even if I don't fix it ASAP, someone may give you a work around.

Ciao!

Agreed.  Without writing some overly complicated code to parse out hidden input tags or something (which are COMPLETELY different in every application), this is just a bug that most people are just going to have to deal with.  Either that or every time you generate the temp file, it's a truly unique file.  But then, that would break the "feature" half of this bug :)

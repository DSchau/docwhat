<a href="http://trac.gerf.org/itsalltext/ticket/4" rel="nofollow">This feature</a> does look nice, but I think all I need is for IAT to check the existence of its editor without barfing on a command-line argument.  I don't need to configure multiple settings for emacs from IAT, and I hadn't been using a shell script before, though I am now.  Since creating <em>emacsclientemacs</em> with 
  #!/bin/sh
  emacsclient --alternate-editor=emacs "$@"
  
I can now use IAT like I used to.

I'd like to point out that changes to IAT's settings haven't taken effect for me until I restart firefox.  When I would change my editing command to not use the argument "--alternate-editor=emacs", the error message continued to show my original command.

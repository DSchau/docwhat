I noticed that Firefox 3.0.1 on Win XP Pro SP2 leaks a lot of memory when
running with IAT 0.8.5 and Gmail (new version) in a tab. It can be as much as
200-600MB when running for a week or so.

I followed the advice at
https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA:Home_Page:Firefox_3.0_TestPlan:Leaks:LeakTesting-How-To
and kept removing add-ons and tabs until no leaks occurred. The minimum
reproducible scenario is: FF 3.0.1 IAT 0.8.5 one tab open with Gmail

BTW, I really appreciate IAT and hope the leaks are simple to track down.

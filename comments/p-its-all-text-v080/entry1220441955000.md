Additional Comment:

andlinux uses iso8859-1 encoding due to windows compatibility. Vim also uses
this as default. When I want to edit wiki text, which is in utf-8 encoding, I
need to set vim's encoding to utf-8. For not doing this manually everytime, I
modified my script above to:

andcmd gvim -c ":set enc=utf-8" /mnt/win/Dokumente\ und\
Einstellungen//Anwendungsdaten/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles//itsalltext/%~nx1

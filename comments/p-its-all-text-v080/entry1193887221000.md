I've been quite pleased with your extension, until now, when a particularly
obnoxious bug has surfaced. I'm not sure if your extension is actually
responsible, but I'm guessing you'll know better than I will.

Whenever I press my WIN key while a text area is focused, an editor window
pops up. This is infuriating, because I use my win key for a lot of keyboard
short cuts.

I'm using Its All Text v.8, Firefox 2.0.0.3, and X11.

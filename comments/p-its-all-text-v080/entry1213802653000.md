Hello, I'm having exactly the same problem as Andrew Hyatt above. IAT simply
ignores what I type into the "Editor:" preference, and reverts to
/usr/bin/open. Also, shell scripts are greyed out by the browser, so I can't
select them by mouse. Eventually I resorted to editing prefs.js directly,
which worked. Mac OS X, Firefox 3rc3, IAT 0.8.5.

First off, I _was_ a Mozex fan, but I've already uninstalled it. IAT is an
awesome extension - thanks much!

I do have a question though - does IAT generate any events for the TEXTAREA
when an update occurs? I've developed a site that has a couple TEXTAREAs that
the user edits in, along with a "Preview" area that I currently update by
setting an onKeyUp handler, which works great when editing within the
TEXTAREA, but if I use IAT, the TEXTAREA updates but my preview does not. I
tried adding an onChange handler, but that didn't work.

Then I tried Event Spy and I see a bunch of mutation events (coloring the
background of textarea), but I don't know if I can set an event handler (or if
I want to, with the many events the fading effect generates). I would think
generating a 'change' event of some sort would be a desirable thing, but maybe
others disagree.

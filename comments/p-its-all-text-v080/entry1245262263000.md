When I put:

The editor field needs to only have a single script.  You can't pass additional arguments.

If you want to use the shell script, then just put in "<code>/Users/foobar/iat.sh</code>".

Alternatively, you can run Aquamacs and from the menu choose "Tools" -> "Install Command Line Tool"

Then you can just enter "<code>/usr/bin/aquamacs</code>" in the editor field.

Ciao!

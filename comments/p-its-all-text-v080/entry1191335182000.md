Zack:

You're quite right. I must have cut-and-pasted that from someplace. I
habitually type <code>"\$@"</code> myself and therefore probably didn't even
give it a second glance.

You are also right in that the file arguments are under IAT's control. They
can never be badly formed. The only potential problem is spaces in the path,
which using <code>"\$@"</code> would fix.

I have fixed this is my source control. Next version will have this fix.
Thanks for pointing it out.

Ciao!

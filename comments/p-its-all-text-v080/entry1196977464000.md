era:

I have my new laptop. I still need to yank the harddrive out of my old laptop
and see what I can recover.

I have on my old laptop the beginning of what will be the next version of IAT.
It refreshes in a totally different (and better and Mozilla approved) way. It
seems to fix this problem.

As an added plus, my new laptop is a MacBook Pro, so I'll see about fixing any
Mac weirdnesses once and for all.

Ciao!

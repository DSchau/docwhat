I'd love to use IAT more, but whenever it's enabled and I use the "Back" button in FF to go back from a Twiki entry preview to the page with the textarea (which is how Twiki want's you to do it), the FF tab (or window) hangs and never returns.  This doesn't happen with just a textarea on a normal page or even a textarea on a Twiki page, but only with the Twiki edit page.  We're using the Dragon skin (lots of Javascript), if it matters.

Unfortunately, the twiki version we're using is quite old (TWiki engine: 02 Sep 2004 $Rev: 1742 $).  It doesn't happen with the current version of Twiki on twiki.org, so I can't really point you to a working test case.  I guess it's just an FYI at this moment unless you can give me some debugging ideas to try or having the page load hang when using the back button to a page with a textarea rings a bell.

I'm also trying to get our twiki updated to the current version.

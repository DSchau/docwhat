I have russian Windows XP and my windows login account is written in cyrillic.
So, when i'm trying to use button "edit" my editor opens non-existing
location, like this (screenshot) -

I think problem is in russian name of windows login account. May be it's worth
to enter own path, where temp texts will be stored?

RichiH:

Thanks for the feedback. I'm enjoying talking to you on IM...

Yeah, it'd be really nice to have something like that. The problem is that
shells and the <tt>exec()</tt> function on different platforms work
differently. FF doesn't expose <tt>execl()</tt>.

I've been thinking of adding an advanced option or something where you are
assumed to know how your local system works. That way people who don't know
(or don't care) can just use the current behavior.

The letting people choose corners is a good idea. I'm wanting to change the
way the edit button appears and disappears anyway. It gets in the way
sometimes.

Thanks again.

Ciao!

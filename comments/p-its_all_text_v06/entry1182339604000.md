Hey, I'm sorry to be a bad news bearer, but your great extension seems to leak
some memory - I have finished with 300M after viewing about 200 pages. It may
due to interaction with my other extensions, but with IAT disabled Firefox
(2.0.0.4 on XP with 512M RAM) stays at 60M all day long. I have not tested the
last version though - sorry if it is a false alert.

Hi Dusan!

Thanks for the feedback!

That sounds like a good idea; I've added it to my todo list. :-D

Right now, I'm working on 1.0 so I'm only working on the last set of bugs (Mac
OS X: preferences not having close buttons & Mac OS X: finding the right
executable). So this will probably be a post 1.0 feature unless I get bored or
something. ^\_^

It's too bad that I cannot detect when the editor quits in Firefox. If I
could, then I could make the textarea editable again once the editor quit.

Thanks again for idea and the feedback. :-)

Ciao!

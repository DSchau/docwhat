Actually, investigating the problem further, it does seem that the problem is
a side effect of installing IAT.

The problem started occurring yesterday, at the very point when I installed
IAT. Nothing in our web server or MediaWiki configuration changed yesterday,
and editing sections of wiki pages, whose URL is also ".php?", works fine.

Furthermore, editing the same wiki page using Internet Explorer works fine.

The problem persisted even after I deinstalled Firefox, rebooted, and
reinstalled it.

The problem persists even after I've followed the advice in article
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Opening_files_using_plugins. (On the browser, the
setting browser.download.pluginOverrideTypes was unchanged (naturally, since I
had reinstalled the browser), and there was no setting
plugin.disable_full_page_plugin_for_types.) I then renamed my profile's
mimeTypes.rdf (whose contents had no reference to the .php filetype, anyway).

So, it seems there's some weird interaction between IAT and the Firefox
browser that causes this problem with URLs that include ".php".

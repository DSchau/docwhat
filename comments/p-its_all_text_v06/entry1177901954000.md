Love the idea but here's the problem.

Anything but text/html as the content type of the document does not work. I
was hoping to use this with the Firefox XForms extension, but doesn't work
because content-type for XForms enabled documents is application/xhtml+xml. In
fact Even non-form tags do not work if the content-type (Right click&gt;Page
Info, or Tools&gt;Page Info) is not text/html.

Just wondering if this was a known issue. Do you plan on having similar
functionality for XUL documents, or xhtml documents (served as xhtml).

Thanks,

-David

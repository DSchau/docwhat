teemu:

The problem you are seeing isn't due to any extension in Firefox. It's the
webserver that is misconfigured. I'm guessing that the PHP extension was
uninstalled or something similar.

Firefox is saying that the file is being served as "PHP" instead of HTML. If
PHP was working, it would interpret the PHP and PHP sets the type to HTML.

Ciao!

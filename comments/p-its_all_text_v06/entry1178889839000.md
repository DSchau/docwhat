Steven:

Sounds like a good idea.  I'll put it in the wish list.

You can disable the button currently by disabling 'In-Page Edit Buttons' in the preferences.  It turns the button off for all pages, which is more than you want, but it should get the job done.  You can right click on a textarea and select "It's All Text!" to get to the items you normally get via the edit button.

Maybe we need a menu item to disable the button temporarily or maybe just move that option into the menu or something.

I'll think about it. Hmm... I wonder if I can detect that there is a link underneath and move the button someplace else?

Ciao!

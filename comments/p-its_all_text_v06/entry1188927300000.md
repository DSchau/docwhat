err;

Unfortunately, FireFox does not report back when a process exits.  Otherwise, I could fix a problems I have to work around.  So the original way you invoked gvim was correct.  You don't need the -f.

Regarding the temp files, they should go away either: when the browser exits or (failing that) after aging a week (I think it was a week.  Maybe a day.)

I don't delete them faster because you can keep your editor open and revisit the same page and make changes by editing the old file. :-)  Assuming that each edit doesn't get a new URL (depends on the site).

Ciao!

Guillem:

Hah! I love it. You were using IAT in a way I never conceived of! Cool!

Let me think&hellip; I hate to add this to the preference panel; it would be
confusing to explain and I want to get 1.0 out before I rework the interface
to make it work better.

If I created an option you could add to prefs.js by hand that would revert to
the previous behavior, would that work for you? It would give you something
till I (or someone else) makes it a real feature.

Ciao!

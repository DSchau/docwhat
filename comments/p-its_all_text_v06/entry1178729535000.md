I really like this extension a lot. However there is a problem when writing Scandinavian letters such as ä, ö, å. The letters are replaced by question marks. I tried installing Notepad++ as advised above but using it made no difference. I'm using Windows Vista but the same problem is with XP as well. Any tips or preferences I could tweak?

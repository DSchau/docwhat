Francisco:

Gracias por la observaciones. That should translate as "Thank you for the
observations". I don't know spanish but I know

:-D

The problem you have is that Notepad is storing the file in something like
Windows-1252 (which I <em>think</em> includes Spanish, but I'm not sure) but
It's All Text! expects UTF-8. You can try figuring out encoding Notepad is
using and change It's All Text! (in it's preferences) to use that. Or you can
get a UTF-8 editor, like

Ciao!

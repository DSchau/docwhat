Thanks for the reply, docwhat. That must be what's wrong, since the problem persisted even after I uninstalled IAT and rebooted the computer, and editing a Wikipedia article works fine.

It's just strange that editing a section of an article in our internal Wiki still works, and that I started the problem right after installing IAT, not before.  But I'll check with our IT department about the web server configuration.

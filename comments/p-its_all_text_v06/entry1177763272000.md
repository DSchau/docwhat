Hi,

I've have a problem using its all text. I'm using latest IAT, firefox 2.0.0.3
on opensuse 10.2

When using the kate editor all is fab.

When I use gvim I get this:

Then tried bluefish and again got this:

Neither application displays correctly now when not being called by IAT. Gimp
has also become infected even though it has never been used as an IAT editor.

So, as Kate is OK, as is 'konsole -e vim' (via bash script), I guess the
common factor is that the others a re gnome applications.

Any ideas?

Where it works IAT is a great little extension - thanks.

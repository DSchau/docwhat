I've installed Stylish and it works fine. I've prefered not to manipulate your work!
In our business we work with an application that opens a new window with a text editor (very slow). This text is stored in a hidden textarea in the main window. Since we've find your extension we are able to edit this text without opening this editor and losing the time it required.
Thanks for making our life better! ;)

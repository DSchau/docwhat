Ted:

How interesting. I haven't heard of something like that before. I don't think
it's IAT. Could it be something outside the browser? Some other application
that is momentarily stealing the focus from Firefox and then giving it back?

Very odd. Can you give me more info? OS, FF version, IAT version? As I said, I
doubt it's IAT but if you include this info, maybe someone else may report
similar problems or know what the cause is.

Ciao!

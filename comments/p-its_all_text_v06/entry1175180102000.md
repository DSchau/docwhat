In the discussion after the original announcement of It's All Text,
Peter was asking how to set up a hook for Emacs to (say) automatically
edit the buffer in text mode.

Given that IAT uses a well-defined directory for all temporary files,
it's not hard to set up a trigger for any file in that particular
directory:

[code]
(or (assoc &quot;/itsalltext/[^/]*\\\\'&quot; auto-mode-alist) ; Don't add hook twice
     (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(&quot;/itsalltext/[^/]*\\\\'&quot; . text-mode)
				 auto-mode-alist)) )
[/code]

Edit to taste; hope this helps.

PS. Thanks for the Wikipedia fix!

Hi Stephen!

I'm about 99.9% sure this isn't IAT!... What it looks like is your font is
unable to display the correct characters. I don't use SUSE, but I know that it
works with multiple languages and character sets, so I'm unsure what could
have caused this.

I hope you figure out what happened, though! I'd be curious to know what
happened.

Ciao!

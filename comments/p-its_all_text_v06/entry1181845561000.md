I have a problem that only occurs with It's All Text enabled. After about
10-15 seconds, whether I am typing or not (though more frequently when I type
in the textarea) the textarea will lose focus. Then further keystrokes will
cause the screen to jerk around. I'm running a few other add-ons, but nothing
that messes with input methods at all. Any ideas?

I upgraded to 0.6.8 and on several systems where I did this I got two tabs
with the "welcome to IAT" chrome page. Not too serious, but a glitch
nevertheless ...

PS. Your Wordpress thinks email addresses with an equals sign in the localpart
are not valid. Is this a configuration option or something in Wordpress
itself?

era:

I use emacs, but didn't realize that \\' was the same as \$. One of the areas
that I don't have much experience. Anyway, I fixed it. For me, this isn't
quite good enough because I have directories hanging around that have
/itsalltext/ in it's path that are not my editing directory. :-)

But I have plenty of rules that do the right thing based on file extension
already:

Ciao!

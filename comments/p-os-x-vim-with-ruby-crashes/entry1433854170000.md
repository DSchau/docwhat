I've been having the same problem and it's driving me crazy! But after copy and paste the code to my `.zshrc` I get this error when I try to enter the `vim` command:

```
vim                                                                                                                                                           (ruby-2.2.0)
env: illegal option -- u
usage: env [-i] [name=value ...] [utility [argument ...]]
```

I'm using `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh` framework

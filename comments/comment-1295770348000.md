Hi, thanks for the code. I notice that on category archives, there are now two thumbnails. It appears that, out-of-the-box, Thematic supports the featured image thumbnail on the category archive. You can see what I mean on your category pages (http://docwhat.org/topic/code/). If the code you give is used, then the other thumbnail should be turned off. Does anyone know how that can be done?

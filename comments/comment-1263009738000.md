Unfortunately, I'm not an expert at FF internals.  I'm sure I'm still doing this less than ideally. :-(

Even worse, IAT doesn't work with FF 3.6 and I don't understand how to troubleshoot and fix what's wrong.  *sigh*

I'd love to port this to Jetpack or Google Chrome, but I'd need to write an NSPlugin to do the actual editor invoking -- There are no ways to call out to the editor from within these environments that I can see.

And I really don't want to write and maintain an NSPlugin.

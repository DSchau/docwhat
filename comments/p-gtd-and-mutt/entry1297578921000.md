Your version of editlabel is exactly what I'm looking for (in particular,
applying it to tagged message).

Unfortunately, I get the following error when I run it:

Traceback (most recent call last): File "editlabel", line 148, in new_label =
do_action(action, infile) File "editlabel", line 122, in do_action new_label =
edit_label(label) File "editlabel", line 77, in edit_label known_labels =
set(get_label_file()) TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

I get this when running editlabel , where is a mail file. Can you assist me?

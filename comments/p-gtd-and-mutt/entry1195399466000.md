Thank you! Very useful, even outside of GTD: just for the labels.

&gt;I like my editlabel better
The same. But cannot point to anything specific (maybe readline).

&gt;But that narrow-wide trick is neat.
What is it?

&gt;evil os.system()
Maybe a comment about the dependancy on formail command could help?

&gt;I haven’t added tab-completion from the &gt;history; I’m not sure if I will or not.
If this is not too much work, it could be appreciated: for emacs users, tab completion feels natural.

Minor comment: instead of duplicating the command in the muttrc, one can use:
macro index,pager

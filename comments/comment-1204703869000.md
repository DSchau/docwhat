RH - I just now tried your suggestion of changing "%1" to %* (no quotes)
in text.bat and IT WORKS!  Problem solved! Thank you!

The Cygwin vim shows me that I'm actually editing a file under
"C:/Documents and Settings/.../Firefox/Profiles/.../itsalltext/..."
Aha - this makes sense now.

docwhat - thank you for the debugging suggestions!

There some tools available now which helps people install docker on mac &amp;
windows e.g boot2docker Check out vagrant. It's a full VM that you write a
recipe for it to automatically install the applications in that recipe, if in
for example you messed up with your VM i.e: `shâ€º$rm -rf /etc` then you can
easily destroy the VM and rebuild again

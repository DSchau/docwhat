What I've been doing, without test-kitchen, is running chef-solo on command line like this:
chef-solo -j nodes/$(hostname).json
I have a json file for each of my nodes and just call it with the --json-attributes (-j) option.
I'd love to be able to implement that in chef-kitchen.
I only use chef-solo and have no Chef Server.

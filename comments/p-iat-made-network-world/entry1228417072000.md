That isn't the issue.

Here is the timeline.

1 - User hits edit. 2 - gvim session appears 3 - user edits file in gvim
session, and writes the file out, exiting the editor 4 - the addon somehow
causes the edit area to flash yellow, indicating the edit is received. 5 -
something dumb happens like the browser crashes, or goes to a new page
automatically and crashes without submitting the text, or the session is lost
and some javascript causes the page to change.

Maybe I misunderstand and there's really a step 6 where I restart the browser
following the Dumb Thing, and that causes it to delete all the temporary
files? I don't know what the timespan of these files is, but I'd prefer it to
be infinite.

Hi Josh!

Actually, it isn't deleted.  All the files are marked as "temporary" by firefox.  If it crashes, temporary files aren't cleaned up.

You should be able to right click on the "edit" button and select "Edit using previous '.txt' content"  (obviously .txt will be whatever extension you edited it as).

If something has changed so that temporary files are being deleted even after a crash, then I'll take a look at it.

Ciao!

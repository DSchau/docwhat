I suspect the code just needs to be looked at more carefully -- there are other addons like Ad-Block and NoScript that also have to watch pages dynamically that don't exact this kind of performance hit.

I'd settle for a status bar icon that let me search for text areas on the current page.  But as useful as IAT is, I simply can't abide the performance hit.

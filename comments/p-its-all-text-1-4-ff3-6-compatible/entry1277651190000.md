I love It's All Text. I loved it since it's first release. However, I always
had issue with it on OS X. I finally found a way! Well at least if you use
Textmate. You first need to install the Terminal app (mate):

-   Click on Help -&gt; Terminal Usage...
-   Choose where you want to install mate
-   Click on "Create Link"

If you already installed the mate command but don't know where it is, open
Terminal.app and type "which mate". Finally, in It's All Text's preferences,
copy the path to the mate command. In my case, it was /usr/bin/mate

Now it should be working fine.

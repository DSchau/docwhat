The "make" line did not work for me but it does not seem to have affected ECB.
It all worked fine.

Note that CEDET is now version 1.1 but ECB requires 1.0pre6. Aquamacs will
warn you but then you will have to go back and redo the first few steps of
this process.

Been trying to find an editor for casual use that has emacs's indenting
functions but NOTHING comes close. ECB makes life a little easier.

Thanks!

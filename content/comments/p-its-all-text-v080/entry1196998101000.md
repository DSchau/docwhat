I guess it's too early to expect it to work with Firefox 3, but I'd like to
point out that there's a problem with the latest beta of Firefox 3
(minefield).

The options/preferences dialogue isn't working at all if it's started from the
edit button. The buttons have no labels and there are no values in the input
field. You DO get the normal options dialogue from within the addons menu, but
even if you put in your editor there, it's still not recognized and you get
the broken options dialogue again (when trying the edit button).

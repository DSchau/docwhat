Hi Doc! I just discovered yout extension and itâ€™s something I was wondering
about for a long time. Great idea along the lines of the KISS principle, just
use an editor for editing text! One is left to wonder why popular apps like
Firefox keep trying to reinvent the wheel in some aspects, instead of relying
in existing, mature tools for the task.

The only (and I mean _only_) nit I have to pick is having to disable backup
files created by Emacs, but I guess the editor is to blame for that.

Thanks a lot!

I love this extension, thanks so much -- I use it all the time.

I have one case that always fails for me though. We use Jira
(http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/) for defect tracking, and it supports
wiki-style formatting.

So I find myself using your extension to enter comments, saving, then using
the Jira preview button to see how the wiki-formatting looks.

Once I've done a preview, the "edit" button disappears. If I reload my page, I
lose everything I've typed so far.

I haven't seen the same thing anywhere else, only with Jira. I'm using Firefox
2 on Windows XP.

If anyone has seen this or knows of a workaround, I'm interested.

Thanks again. RH Austin, TX

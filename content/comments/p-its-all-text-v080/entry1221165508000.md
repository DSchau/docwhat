I initially had trouble getting IAT to work on my Mac (FF 3.0.1) since it kept
silently failing when I tried using a hacked-together script of mine to get it
to load inside vim in Terminal.app. I finally tracked it to escaping issues on
my end. For anyone interested, you can save this as an executable text file
and set it as IAT's editor:

#!/bin/bash osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal"^Mactivate^Mdo script
with command "vim \"'"\$@"'\"; osascript -e \"tell application
\\\"Firefox\\\"^Mactivate^Mend tell\"; exit"^Mend tell'

This will switch focus to Terminal.app, open a new terminal window, run vim in
that window with the IAT file opened in it; and when you quit from vim, the
terminal window will be closed, and focus will return to Firefox.

I'm doubtful that the subtle escaping and line-feeds will survive
copy-and-paste, so you can get the original at:

(Note: "^M" in the script is a special character produced by hitting ctrl-V
and then &lt;return&gt;. It gets interpreted as a line feed, which is very
different from the characters "^" and "M".)

Make sure to use "Save Page As..." (and add execute permissions!), since
copying-and-pasting from your browser would probably break it as well.

HTH, Greg

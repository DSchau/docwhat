Tom:

Yeah, you can't set the way the argument is passed in IAT. This is because it
either:

<ol>
  <li>requires IAT to know too much about all the platforms Firefox can possibly run on</li>
  <li>requires the user to know too much about how shells and arguments work.</li>
</ol>

Meanwhile, you can try to toubleshoot the problem by invoking the .bat file
from the CMD line using a path that has a space in it. Use quoting, not
backslashes to escape the spaces, that's what IAT does.

Also, you could try to switch to a .cmd script instead of .bat; you'll have
more options for dealing with spaces.

Ciao!

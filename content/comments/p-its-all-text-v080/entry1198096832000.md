It happens repeatably on our internal Zimbra email system. I tried to make it
happen on various public sites but I cannot. I even tried the public Zimbra
site but they don't seem to use text boxes there -- strange. I could try to
capture the html from these internal examples and send them to you but I am
not sure what would be useful.

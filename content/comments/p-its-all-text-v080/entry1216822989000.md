"It's All Text!" will not launch any text editor on my system:

Windows XP SP-3 Firefox 3.0.1 (Gecko/2008070208) It's All Text 0.8.5

I've tried Notepad++, Visual Studio, Notepad, and Wordpad. Every time I browse
to and set an editor, It's All Text complains that it can't launch the editor.
I even tried putting in the full path when browsing.

I'm running as a user on my local system that is a member of the
Administrators group.

I also have these Firefox add-ons enabled:

/FindBar/ Adblock Plus Better Gmail2 BugMeNot ColorfulTabs ColorZilla Download
Statusbar DownThemAll! FireFTP Flagfox Flashblock Foxmarks Full Screen
Homestar Runner Gmail Space Greasemonkey IE Tab It's All Text! MeasureIt
NoScript Remove It Permanently Web Developer WOT

I have a theme installed, but it is disabled (no theme active)

I can try it with my add-ons disabled, but it's a pain to do so (hence looking
to see if any know issues). Thanks!

This is a great extension. I use Emacs (Carbon version on a Mac running
Leopard). I can get IAT to launch Emacs and edit text; everything works as
advertised. What I'd like better is, if Emacs is already running, it brings up
a window in my already-running Emacs with the text to be edited in it. That
way, if I use it to edit mail (in a browser, for my Gmail account), I don't
have to re-launch Emacs for every message I compose. I can do this from
Thunderbird, using a no-longer-supported add-on called External Editor. I'd
like to do it from IAT. I believe it involves using the server feature of
Emacs. Have you run into this question before?

Maybe you should look into moving your site to a dedicated hosting site. I've
been running my sites on a shared server but dedicated IP address and it's
been running flawlessly and pretty cheap. If you can't do shared hosting you
can always do a dedicated VPS server. Just a recommendation cause that service
just seems ridiculously horrible.

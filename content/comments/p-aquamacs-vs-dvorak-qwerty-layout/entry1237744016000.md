There is a bug with this. It doesn't fix Command-W. This seems to be because
setting ',' requires using a different technique.

Here's what `osxkeys.el` uses to set customize (preferences):

```lisp
(define-key map (vector (list osxkeys-command-key '\,) ) 'customize)
```

I've added a patch for this in the function `fix()`:

```python
# This patches the problem with the customize.

if line.strip() == """(define-key map (vector (list osxkeys-command-key '\,) ) 'customize)""":
    rows[i] = line.replace("'customize", "'close-window")
    continue
```

This is a great extension and brilliant idea!

But I have problems to use it on my MacOSX(10.6.5)+FF3.6.12. It worked for a
while when I downloaded and installed in the first time. After sometime all
functions just don't work, no icon beside textarea, no shortcuts. I tried to
use different editor shell and others, but that didn't help.

These days I've updated to latest version of 1.5, but it still don't work. I
think i'll do some debug with source code to check wha'ts going on.

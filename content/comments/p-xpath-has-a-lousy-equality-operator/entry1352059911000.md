A reply that is a couple of years late, but to clarify:

The expression `//node = 'red fish'` will compare the computed string value of
each of the selected node elements, and if any of the items in the set equal
"red fish", it will return `true()`.

If you wanted to select the node element's who's computed string value is "red
fish", you could use the following: `//node[. = 'red fish']`, which uses a
predicate filter to select only the `node` element's who's computed string
value equals "red fish".

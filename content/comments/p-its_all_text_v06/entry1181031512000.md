Hi! I use this extension every day, specially for editing hidden textareas.
Today with the last update i've found that all buttons have disapeared!! I
supose that this was a 'bug' for you but it's a salvation for me. I propose to
add an option to activate or not this feature.

Thanks a lot for this magnific extension!

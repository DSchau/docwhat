I recently got IAT, and for the most part, IAG (it's all good!). I am running
FF 2.0.0.4, and a number of other extensions, and using FF2's session
save/restore capability. However, when I restarted FF to use IAT, every one of
my session tabs turned into "Welcome to IAT!" tabs. Again, when I upgraded
this morning to IAT 0.7, not only did my four previous tabs all turn in to
"Welcome to IAT!" tabs, but about six or eight new ones were added, all for
"Welcome to IAT!" One of them hung FF, and I had to kill -9 it. I don't know
if it is a bug in IAT, or a weird interaction between IAT and some other
extensions, but it is kind of annoying. ;-)

Thanks, though, for creating IAT, as it is handy (barring that one weird
glitch). ;-)

Hey! Opening all these apps in OSX is great, but what if I want vim in a
terminal? My solution: Use a shell script to run an AppleScript to open a
terminal, instruct it to run vim, and close when I exit the editor.

Hacky, sure. It works though.

vim.scpt is for iTerm, Terminal.scpt is for MacOSX Terminal.app

When I'm doing any web development work I always have the Firefox console open
to display ALL messages. I often see a copious number of info messages that
say:

itsalltext: refreshing {URL}

It appears to me that it shows one message for every tab per refresh period.
If I haven't actually clicked any edit buttons, then ITA! code shouldn't be
running at all, right? Anyway, not a big problem, and you've probably already
fixed it. What I'm really trying to say is "nice extension" :).

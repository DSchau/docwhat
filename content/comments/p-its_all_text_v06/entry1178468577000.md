Great extension! Unfortunately it does not work together with the TinyMCE HTML
editor. The entry in the context menu does not appear. The button is covered
by the text area and cannot be clicked. I could fix the button position in the
code. So I can actually start the editor. But the changed text does not get
back into the textarea. There seems to be a conflict between TinyMCE and "It's
All Text". Would be great if they would both work in the same document! Thank
you.

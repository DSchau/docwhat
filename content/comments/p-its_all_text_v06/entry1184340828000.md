Hi,

thanks for the great plugin - it's really helpful and worth to work on it!

I have one Problem: I'm using the plugin InFormEnter as well as It's all text.
InFormEnter puts a button right after each form field. It's helping to put
predefined text into each form field. After installing It's all Text the
InFormEnter Plugin puts TWO buttons after each textarea form field. I'm no
programmer, but it looks like that some process modifying the webpage is
processed double. Maybe you can discuss the problem with the programmer of
InFormEnter.

best thomas

Hi,

I just discovered this plugin and it's very useful to me. But I noticed one of
the bugs you think you fixed "\* Fixed the context menu jumping all over the
place." isn't really fixed at all for me. When I right-click the edit button,
the outline of the menu appears in it's correct place for a moment, then moves
to the right-hand edge of the screen, then to the lower-right corner where it
stays put and draws completely. Now a show-stopper but it sure is annoying.

Thanks for such a useful extension!

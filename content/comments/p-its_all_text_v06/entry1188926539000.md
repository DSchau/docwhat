First, very nice.

A Few things

1. I'm using gvim on windows, so path is like "C:\stuff\gvim.exe". This starts
   up gvim async (it forks). I thought I'd try starting it sync, with the '-f'
   option, and see if I could detect any differences in "IAT" behavior. In
   particular I was wondering if it might affect the following issues. I tried
   "c:\stuff\gvim.exe -f", but that failed. I guess if you want options you
   need to set up a script. I made a iat.cmd and put "c:\stuff\gvim.exe -f" in
   it, it starts the editor, but not with the right file. I don't know the
   windows equivelent of "\$\*". Also, when it started there was that anoying
   command.com window as well.

2. accumulation of temp file, any issues here? They don't seem to go away (at
   least not very quickly). I thought if the editor started up sync, you would
   know when the editor exitted and be able to handle the delete.

3. While the editor is active, if I modify the textArea through the browser...
   Again, if IAT knew when the editor exited, maybe could warn that changes
   made would be lost.

Thanks a lot for this extension.

Thank you for this interesting article. But the source code is not visible.
Instead the text says : "Could not embed GitHub Gist 5889193: Must specify
two-factor authentication OTP code." Fortunately one can figure out the gist
original url : https://gist.github.com/docwhat/5889193

By the way: I found your blog due to your "it's all text" firefox extension.
Just like you I don't like bash that much but use it when the cost-benefit
analysis favors it, and it happens often for disposable hacks in a Linux
environment. And I've been using <code>set -eu</code> in all my bash programs
for years. Cheers!

Your best bet when working with foreign DLLs in .NET is to create a COM
interop wrapper assembly in C#. Basically you build a C# class that wraps the
functionality you need from your COM DLLs, which is sometimes easiest as a
static class.

You may want to refer to this article:

However, there are also plenty of examples of open source code that do COM
interop.

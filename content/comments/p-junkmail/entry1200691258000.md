Yes Greendimes.com appears to be a slick SCAM, trying to portray themselves as
doing a great service. It look longer than promised to receive the post cards
to sign and I only got four of them, the number you can make from one sheet of
paper. I researched the topic of stopping junk mail and there are a few more
than four major players that need a signature to opt-out. They also still
asked me to go to the DMA's site and opt-out there. Some catalog items I
requested to stop over a month ago are still "pending". If you want to remove
catalogs, you can go to Catalogchoice.org.

Maybe it's me, but I can't seem to get "It's All Text" to work. I see the
grey'd out Edit button, but when I click on it, I get the following message:
"I was unable to run your editor, 'usr/bin/gedit' You the browse button to
choose another editor and try again." Could you tell me how I might fix my
problem? Also, You might want to change the word "You" in the error message to
"Use."

Christian,

&gt; The second change is the harder to deal with one. Previously I had &gt;
this flow: &gt; &gt; 1. Load page &gt; 1. delete all files for textareas in
this page &gt; 2. If file updates on disk then refresh the textarea &gt; 3. If
user clicks edit: &gt; 1. If file doesn\u2019t exist, then create it &gt; 2.
Open editor on file &gt; &gt; However, this causes problems because if a user
visits the same page &gt; twice, then they can end up deleting already done
work.

I don't understand this. The first time you visit the page you open your
editor by clicking on 'edit'. This creates a new file when you save (since all
previous files have been deleted.) Then you go somewhere else and after a
while come back to the page you were editing. OK, IAT removes all previous
files, but you still have your editor open with the latest contents. Whenever
you save the next change, IAT will update the text field. I don't see how this
can cause loss of data, unless you close your editor without saving or you
save but you move to a different page before the field gets updated. Unless I
am missing something.

Ciao,

Giuseppe

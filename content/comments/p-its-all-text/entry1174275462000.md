Mario Grgic:

I finally, finally, finally have fixed the edit button for all the places it
has been broken. I think this was the correct fix, I understand new things,
etc. etc. The next version should be fixed. Alas, addons.mozilla.org is not
yet done migrating. When they do, I'll submit a new version.

Re: the context menu. It is one of the last things I am still fixing before
version 1. It currently only works when you right-click on a textarea.

Ciao!

I have installed the new version (4.2). However the button is displayed far
away from the textarea when using it in Wikipedia.

I discovered what causes the problem: the button is positioned on an absolulte
place from the top and left depending on the width and height of the window.
However the real position is not related to the top-left corner of the window,
but the top-left position of the div where it is wrapped in. That div is
placed 2.8em from the top and 12.2em from the left, so the edit-button is also
placed at that distance from the textarea.

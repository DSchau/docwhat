The identity-trust problem is a sticky one and no OS vendor has done well. I
suspect asking users would be useless, too, as users would just stomp on
"Yes".

There are smarter people than me working on it and I don't think they have a
solution.

Re: SecureTransport -- That's where most of Apple's brain power is aimed at,
at the moment. I trust it reasonably well. I like the direction LibreSSL is
going.

However, I feel like there should be a common API for looking up trusted CA
roots with a never changing API. So Apple can return a certificate from the
Keychain while Windows returns it from their Secure Store.

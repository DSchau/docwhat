For lines 31-37, could you do this instead?

initial_location = "/usr/bin" initial_location = "C:\\" if :windows == OS
initial_location = "/Applications" if :mac == OS
fc.setCurrentDirectory(java.io.File.new(initial_location))

From 7 lines to 4, and arguably more readable. Just flexing my early morning
refactoring brain.

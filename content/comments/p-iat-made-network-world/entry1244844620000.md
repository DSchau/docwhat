The performance has improved with 3.5pre.

The main performance hit is when I focus on the window, though focusing on any
text dialog seems to also have a delay before the browser is ready to let me
type.

Since you mention tabs... I am also using the TreeStyleTab extension, could
this interact with IAT?

Thanks,

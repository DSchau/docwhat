Akihabara is great, but save it until last because there's so much else to see
in Japan and for your first trip, you might want to spend your money enjoying
the country first, THEN buying gadgets. It'll make your eyes water the stuff
they had even 10 years ago! Get someone to fly you over for a conference and
chances are, they;ll give you someone geeky to take you around to the best
shops!
